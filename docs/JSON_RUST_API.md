# Rust native JSON API

The Rust frontend now checks and compiles immutable JSON values through the
validating native runtime. The C frontend retains its legacy string-copy source
API. The REPL evaluates the same dynamic API using immutable Rust values and the
same format/error profile. Values and closures persist across successful entries;
failed evaluations do not commit new bindings.

Use `json` or the compatibility spelling `Json`. Qualified annotations
`json.Value`/`json.Error` and `Json.Value`/`Json.Error` identify the same opaque
types. Ordinary user types named `Value`, `Error` or `Json` remain available.
Opaque values work in generic functions, records, collections and closures; they
cannot be constructed as records, inspected through fields, compared, used as
Map keys, printed or interpolated implicitly. Print encoded text or error details.

```fern
json.parse(String) -> Result(json.Value, json.Error)
json.stringify(json.Value) -> Result(String, json.Error)
json.is_null(json.Value) -> Bool
json.get(json.Value, String) -> Result(json.Value, json.Error)
json.at(json.Value, Int) -> Result(json.Value, json.Error)
json.length(json.Value) -> Result(Int, json.Error)
json.as_bool(json.Value) -> Result(Bool, json.Error)
json.as_int(json.Value) -> Result(Int, json.Error)
json.as_float(json.Value) -> Result(Float, json.Error)
json.as_string(json.Value) -> Result(String, json.Error)
json.number_text(json.Value) -> Result(String, json.Error)
json.elements(json.Value) -> Result(List(json.Value), json.Error)
json.members(json.Value) -> Result(List((json.Value, json.Value)), json.Error)
json.error_code(json.Error) -> Int
json.error_offset(json.Error) -> Int
json.error_message(json.Error) -> String
json.error_path(json.Error) -> String

json.null() -> json.Value
json.from_bool(Bool) -> json.Value
json.from_int(Int) -> json.Value
json.from_float(Float) -> Result(json.Value, json.Error)
json.from_string(String) -> Result(json.Value, json.Error)
json.from_number_text(String) -> Result(json.Value, json.Error)
json.from_array(List(json.Value)) -> Result(json.Value, json.Error)
json.from_object(Map(String, json.Value)) -> Result(json.Value, json.Error)
```

This is an explicit unreleased Rust-source migration. `parse` now returns a Value
and an opaque Error, replacing the former String/Int payloads. `stringify("[]")`
is a type error: parse `"[]"` for an array, or use `from_string("[]")` for a JSON
string that encodes as `"\"[]\""`. Both legacy C ABI symbols remain unchanged.
The canonical source API reference labels the C signatures separately.

Parsing preserves exact number spelling, validates Unicode, rejects duplicate
decoded keys, and preserves object insertion order. `as_int` never rounds through
Float. `as_float` performs explicit binary64 rounding, rejecting overflow and
nonzero values rounded to zero. `from_float` rejects NaN/infinity and uses a
private thread-local C-locale `%.17g` conversion, preserving negative zero.
`from_number_text` accepts exactly one JSON number token without whitespace/BOM.

`length` counts arrays or object members. `elements` and `members` copy collection
storage once and retain immutable children. Member keys are JSON String values,
so keys containing escaped NUL remain lossless; `as_string` reports a precise error
for those keys while `stringify` renders the escape. Array indexing, missing keys
and type mismatches return distinct ordinary Result errors. `?`, matching and
function defers work normally. Builder failures use offset `-1`; parse failures
use original byte offsets. See [the stable error table](JSON_NATIVE_CORE.md).

Builders enforce depth 128, expanded-node 100,000, logical allocation 32 MiB and
encoded content 16 MiB bounds before publishing a value. Scalar input is at most
1 MiB; aggregate object key bytes are at most 16 MiB and are also constrained by
encoded/allocation/work limits. Shared children count on every encoded appearance,
so repeatedly doubling an array cannot create an accepted exponential encoding.
A source Map has already applied last-wins/first-position replacement; object
construction preserves its resulting order. Native parallel-list callers get a
duplicate-key error instead of a second replacement policy.

Encoding can exceed the stricter 1 MiB parse-input limit, for example when large
strings contain many escaped controls. The maximum 16 MiB output is therefore not
a promise that every encoded value can be parsed again under the input cap.

The native boundary uses full-width opaque pointers and heap Results. Float builder
arguments use QBE `d`/C `double`. Member records use two native pointer fields;
the compiler checks Result success before converting them into tagged Fern tuples.
The Map argument is evaluated once, then copied in one bounded pass to parallel
native lists. No C object is reinterpreted as an unrelated Fern tuple or Map.
Adapter storage is included in the documented per-operation allocation reservation:
objects reserve `16 * max(count,1) + 2*sizeof(FernList)` bytes; members reserve at
most `56 * max(count,1) + 2*sizeof(FernList)` bytes, including tuple conversion.

The native gate runs ten exact-output programs and twelve semantic rejection
cases, including direct/first-class calls, NUL members, signed 64-bit Int/Float values,
opaque values retained through GC, deferred cleanup, and shared-tree limits.
Eight Rust integration tests additionally cover qualified aliases, formatting,
public-IR signature rejection and retained interactive wrappers.
[Typed codecs](JSON_TYPED_CODECS.md) add `json.encode(value)`,
`json.decode(text, TargetType)` and explicit `derive(Json)` on acyclic records.
They preserve these dynamic operations and report field/index paths through
`json.error_path`. Dynamic failures retain an empty path.

## Interactive resource limits

The REPL uses a safe, std-only JSON implementation. It preserves exact number
lexemes, signed zero, native builder spelling, byte offsets, duplicate-key order,
all eleven ordinary Result errors and escaped NUL. Opaque previews show
`<json.Value>`/`<json.Error>`; explicit source printing still requires conversion.
JSON String arguments observe the prefix before raw NUL, matching the native
NUL-terminated ABI. Decoded escaped NUL remains lossless in JSON; `as_string`
returns error 10 when it cannot expose that string through the source String ABI.

Each JSON operation retains the native profile above. One interactive entry also
has separate 64 MiB ceilings for aggregate charged JSON work and logical allocation;
cleanup has independent 8 MiB reserves. Aggregate allocation charges also account
for larger Rust node/collection storage; native logical per-operation counters
remain unchanged. Failed attempts consume charges before
execution. Exceeding an aggregate ceiling uses the existing interactive evaluation
fault and cleanup rules, preserving the first failure. Ordinary JSON errors remain
Result values and can be handled or retained. Existing interactive output/work
limits and the 16 MiB/200,000 retained-value limits still apply; these can be tighter
than the maximum output of an individual JSON operation.

The retained graph walk counts unique shared nodes, text/vector storage and edges
iteratively, including values captured in closures. Repeated aliases do not multiply
subtrees; independent graphs consume storage separately. Existing output buffering,
local file effects and failed-entry commit rules are unchanged. This does not make
external file writes transactional, or add invalid-byte support to REPL File.read.

Six REPL integration tests reuse all ten native JSON output oracles and cover
cross-entry closures, offsets, rollback and shared storage. Fifteen private engine
tests cover resource boundaries, cleanup budgets, exact 16 MiB encoding, DAG limits,
and 6,000 decimal/binary64 plus 6,000 Float formatting oracles. The independent
checksum generator is `scripts/json_repl_oracles.py`; it is test tooling, never
called by JSON evaluation. Typed codecs and default-command migration remain
future work. Decision96 retains the old C source API only for the explicitly
selected bootstrap/reference compiler after the verified Rust default switch.
