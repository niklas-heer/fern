# Morrow Language - Decision Log

This document tracks major architectural and technical decisions made during the development of the Morrow programming language and compiler.

## Project Decision Log

### 156 Move heap ownership from thread-local storage to an explicit Domain
* **Date**: 2026-09-15
* **Status**: Adopted; step 1 of five toward parallel actor execution
* **Decision**: Heap ownership moves out of `thread_local! { static STORE }` into an explicit `Domain` value. The thread-local keeps only a cursor to the domain executing on this thread, installed by an `Activation` guard that restores the previous value on drop. `Domain` is `Send`; `Root` and `Scope` stay thread-bound and keep their `PhantomData<Rc<()>>` markers. Foreign entry point signatures and the compiler's symbol contract are unchanged. Message payloads remain copied without exception: no shared, reference-counted payload representation may arrive as part of a scheduler change. Determinism becomes a property of the simulation driver rather than of the runtime, and ThreadSanitizer joins the quality gate.
* **Context**: The scheduler executes on one thread and the [BEAM comparison](benchmarks/language-comparison/BEAM.md) records actor throughput, scheduler fairness and fault recovery as unmeasured. Reaching parallelism requires changing the ownership model, which is the hardest thing in the runtime to change once more code depends on it. Reading the tree corrected two planning assumptions. Per-actor heap isolation already existed: `Store` held a `BTreeMap` of slots each owning a `Heap`, selected by an `active` cursor, which is structurally BEAM's current-process pointer. And although the runtime exposes 257 `no_mangle` entry points, they reach the store through roughly twelve functions in `memory.rs`, so no entry point signature or call site outside `memory/heaps.rs` changed. Two findings emerged during the work. Invocation-heap collection scans every actor heap in the domain for control words, a collection-time coupling sharper than the control edges the design identified; a domain must therefore own its actor heaps rather than lend them out, which constrains the scheduler design in step 2. And `Root::drop` can run from a finalizer during collection, which would re-enter the cursor while `collect_active` holds the domain; `RefCell` made that a panic, so the cursor path keeps an explicit aliasing guard rather than allowing undefined behaviour.
* **Evidence**: The seeded actor scenario produces trace hash `01a55a0046de5614` before and after the change, with identical 48,334 callbacks, 1,226 delivered, 3,774 timeouts, 2,501 restarts and 9,977 churn actors, and zero live actors, messages, heap bytes and heap objects at cleanup. Record and replay round-trips. The runtime library suite grows from 99 to 107 tests with no failures, including a cross-heap edge oracle whose negative case fabricates an edge the collector would never build, so the oracle is demonstrably able to fail. ThreadSanitizer runs the instrumented suite clean: 107 tests, zero race reports, 2,389.85 s on one Apple M4, rebuilding the standard library from source because the shipped one is not instrumented. The full macOS ARM64 gate passes: 316 native-output fixtures, 20 examples, 63 dynamic compatibility programs, 295 atomic rejections and 64+192+231 fuzz cases.
* **Measured cost**: The allocation-heavy immutable-model workload (`workloads.mr model 100000`) regresses from a 59.03 ms to a 59.96 ms median, +0.93 ms or +1.58%, over 25 interleaved samples per build on one Apple M4. The shift is consistent across minimum, median and p95. The allocation-light scalar workload (`workloads.mr scalar 20000000`) moves +0.09%, within noise, which locates the cost in the allocation path: the un-activated default path now performs two thread-local accesses where it previously performed one. `libmorrow_runtime.a` grows from 13,494,480 to 13,506,976 bytes and benchmark executables by 1,088 bytes. The regression is recorded rather than rounded off. Step 2 runs every actor under an activated domain, which makes the cursor path rather than the default path hot; whether that recovers the difference is a measurement for that step, not an assumption here.
* **Consequences**: A scheduler may own one `Domain` per thread, which is what step 2 requires. Bit-exact replay of a real multi-threaded run is permanently unavailable in a BEAM-shaped runtime, because Erlang guarantees signal ordering only pairwise between two processes and never a global order across schedulers; TigerBeetle and FoundationDB retain total determinism by keeping their cores single-threaded instead. Seeded replay therefore covers logical scheduling and sanitizers cover the physical layer of atomics and memory ordering, which is the class of defect that replaces the ones replay used to catch. The ThreadSanitizer job takes about 40 minutes and finds nothing while execution is single-threaded; it exists now so the harness and any suppressions are in place before parallel schedulers make it load-bearing. `Heap` widens to `pub(crate)` so the domain's crate-visible accessors can name it. The compatibility mailbox scheduler in `actors/api.rs` keeps its own thread-local and is untouched, because it does not execute actor functions.

### 155 Rename the language to Morrow
* **Date**: 2026-09-15
* **Status**: Adopted; migration verification is tracked in ROADMAP.md
* **Decision**: Rename Fern to **Morrow**, using “the Morrow programming language” in public introductions. The command is `morrow`, source files use `.mr`, the repository moves to `morrow-lang/morrow`, and the canonical domain is `morrow-lang.org`; `morrow-lang.dev` will redirect permanently to it. Rename all workspace `fern*` packages and component directories to `morrow*`, including the runtime and JSON packages. Rename the contributor style guide to `MORROW_STYLE.md`. Use a text mark until a new logo is available.
* **Context**: Fern collides with fern-lang.org, fern-lang.com, buildwithfern.com and a Handmade Network language. Niklas has selected Morrow following his naming research: no existing trademark covering programming tools was identified in that research; Daan Leijen's 2004 Morrow is an inactive academic research language, and the existing `morrow` crate on crates.io is an unrelated Minecraft mod SDK. This records the supplied research and decision, not a new legal clearance. The EUIPO/DPMA check for classes 9/42 remains Niklas's open follow-up. Both domains were unregistered on 2026-09-15, and registration and the `.dev` redirect remain his responsibility.
* **Consequences**: Workspace package `morrow` and the `morrow` executable retain the selected development names. Because crates.io's `morrow` name is occupied, that workspace package is not publishable under its current name; future registry distribution must use `morrow-lang` for the compiler package and `morrow-*` for components. No crates are published by this migration. Old source extensions, editor identifiers and component names are replaced together; native ABI artifacts must be rebuilt with the renamed compiler/runtime. Dated reports, benchmark results and earlier decision entries retain their original names, dates and measurement context with an explanatory rename note. The migration is a staged, conventionally committed series with `cargo xtask check` between stages.

* **Data compatibility**: Existing cluster hash-domain bytes and checkpoint placement headers retain their legacy spelling. These are persisted identity inputs, not public branding: changing them would move room ownership or reject acknowledged checkpoints during a language rename. Their independent fixed-vector tests remain in place.

Historical note: Fern was renamed to Morrow on 2026-09-15; earlier decision entries below retain their original wording.

### 154 Generate HexDocs-style documentation sites from `@moduledoc`/`@doc` with an in-tree Markdown renderer
* **Date**: 2026-09-14
* **Status**: Adopted; parser, formatter, Markdown, site, CLI and xtask regressions pass; the repository site is inspected in a real browser
* **Decision**: Add `@moduledoc """..."""` as a module-level documentation attribute that appears once, after the `module` line and before the first declaration; the parser attaches it to `Program.module_doc` with the module name as target, the formatter emits it before imports and doctest extraction runs its examples like `@doc` examples. `fern doc --site <dir>` renders a directory of modules plus `--extras` Markdown guides into a multi-page static site: one page per module with a summary table, grouped functions/types, original and checked signatures, a persistent sidebar, a client-side search index, light/dark themes, `--title`/`--version` branding and `--link` navigation entries. Documentation text is Markdown rendered by a bounded in-tree renderer (`documentation::markdown`): CommonMark headings, fenced code with Fern highlighting, lists, tables, quotes, rules and inline emphasis/code/links; raw HTML blocks are escaped to text, link destinations are limited to `http(s)`, `mailto` and relative paths, and inline code naming a declaration (`area`, `geometry.shapes.area`) becomes a cross-reference. Output size, nesting depth, file count and declaration count are explicit limits. Sites publish through a sibling temporary directory and an atomic rename, refuse destinations inside a source tree or containing unexpected files, and never follow replacement links. `cargo xtask docs [dir] [--no-rust]` builds the repository's own site from `docs/*.md`, the top-level guides and `examples/`, and copies `cargo doc --workspace --no-deps` output under `rust/` so the Rust compiler API is one navigation entry away.
* **Context**: Existing `fern doc` produced one Markdown or HTML page per invocation with literal `@doc` text, no module descriptions, no Markdown rendering and no cross-links. Elixir's HexDocs demonstrates that documentation written next to code, with executable examples and one navigable site, is what makes a library ecosystem usable. Pulling in a Markdown crate would have added an unbounded parser and raw HTML passthrough to the compiler binary; the compiler already owns its Fern lexer, so a small bounded renderer with Fern-aware highlighting keeps the site safe and dependency-free. Rust API documentation stays with `cargo doc`, which is the canonical Rust tool; the site links to it rather than re-implementing rustdoc.
* **Consequences**: Documentation authors write Markdown and reference declarations by name; unresolved references stay as code spans. The renderer is a dialect, not full CommonMark: nested block structures inside list items, footnotes, reference-style links and raw HTML are unsupported and documented as such in `docs/DOCUMENTATION.md`. Generated trait methods (`$`-prefixed schemes) are omitted from inferred signatures. Search is a static JSON index filtered in the browser, sufficient for repository-scale sites; hosted full-text search and versioned multi-release sites remain open. `@moduledoc` is counted by the preflight documentation budget and its examples run under `fern test --doc` with the module in scope.

### 153 Sort structured elements through Ord with a runtime-driven merge; show strings as literals
* **Date**: 2026-09-14
* **Status**: Adopted; independent runtime state-machine, native output, REPL, wasm and checker tests pass
* **Decision**: Add the higher-order builtin `List.sort_by(items, compare: (a, a) -> Ordering)`. `List.sort` keeps the runtime scalar orders for `Int`, `Float`, `Bool`, `String` and newtypes over them; for every other element type, including generic parameters, the checker rewrites it to `List.sort_by(items, compare)` using the `Ord` trait method, activating the trait prelude on demand like `println`. Sorting is a stable bottom-up merge sort whose control state lives in a collector-managed runtime object (`fern_sort_begin/next/report/finish`): the runtime chooses which positions to compare, compiled code performs each comparison through the typed closure and reports the `Ordering` tag, and the runtime materializes the permutation. No C callback crosses the runtime boundary. `Show(String)` now renders a Fern string literal (`String.quote`: quotes plus `\" \\ \n \r \t` escapes) natively, in the REPL and in the browser target, and `Ord(Float)` joins the prelude with NaN comparing `Equal`. `println` of a generic parameter routes through `Show` unless the program defines its own `show`.
* **Context**: Decision 151 rejected structured elements at check time and Decision 152 left generic bodies scalar-only. Writing a merge sort in Fern source costs quadratic copying on array lists, and the higher-order lowering invariant forbids native callbacks. `println(["a", ""])` printed `[a, ]`, hiding empty and spaced strings.
* **Consequences**: `derive(Ord)` types, tuples, options and lists sort with the same lexicographic order as `compare`. `List.sort_by` needs 316 native fixtures, the runtime inventory grows to 300 symbols, and the browser target reports `List.sort_by` as an unavailable host capability. Result-bearing elements are rejected by the obligation proof rather than given invented positions; the comparator itself is proven once over two general elements. Programs that rely on the old raw string rendering must update expected output.

### 152 Print structured values through Show with an on-demand prelude
* **Date**: 2026-09-14
* **Status**: Adopted; checker, REPL and native output tests pass
* **Decision**: `print`/`println` keep the direct path for `Int`, `Float`, `Bool` and `String`. For lists, maps, options, results, tuples, nominal types and unions the checker rewrites the argument to a call of the `Show` trait method, using exactly the path a hand-written `show(value)` takes. When the trait prelude is not active, the checker fails with a marker diagnostic and the pipeline reruns once with the prelude forced, unless the program itself declares a prelude name. Pair tuple instances are always derived because pairs arise from `List.zip`, `List.enumerate` and runtime results without tuple syntax.
* **Context**: `println([1, 2])` was rejected with a scalar-only message although a derived `Show` already existed for every structural type. Activating the prelude for every program would add parsing and checking work and would collide with user declarations of `Ordering` or `show`. Types are unknown before checking, so activation must be demand-driven.
* **Consequences**: Programs printing only scalars are unchanged and pay nothing. Programs printing structured values check twice at most, and only when they use no other trait feature. Generic parameters initially kept the existing print capability, so `fn f(x: a): println(x)` required scalar instantiations; Decision 153 routes them through `Show` as well. `Unit` and function values remain rejected. A missing `Show` reports the rendered type with a derive hint. `Show(String)` was the raw text at this point; Decision 153 changed it to a quoted literal.

### 151 Report argument type mismatches before missing labels; add sort, zip, range, sum and checked arithmetic
* **Date**: 2026-09-14
* **Status**: Adopted; independent runtime ABI, native output, REPL and inventory tests pass
* **Decision**: Check argument types before enforcing required labels so a wrong type is the first report; a call with correct types and a missing label still fails. Add `List.sort` (element-directed: Int/Bool words, Float total order, String bytes, rejecting other elements at check time through a `Sort` capability), `List.zip` (runtime-built compiler-layout pair tuples), `List.range` (half-open, bounded) and `List.sum` (wrapping). Add `Int.checked_add/sub/mul/div/rem/neg` returning `Option(Int)`.
* **Context**: `add(1, "two")` reported only the missing label (Decision 7), hiding the type error. Sorting, pairing, counting and summing required hand-written recursion, and the documented wrapping default (Decision 55) had no checked companion.
* **Consequences**: Label requirements are unchanged in meaning; only diagnostic order differs. `List.sort` on structured elements was a checker error at this point; Decision 153 added ordering through `compare`. Range and zip fault beyond 16,777,216 elements like other allocation limits. The runtime symbol inventory grows to 295 and the lowering audit substitutes tuple return schemes. See `docs/STDLIB_API_REFERENCE.md`.

### 150 Provide non-faulting positional list access and exact integer parsing
* **Date**: 2026-09-14
* **Status**: Adopted; independent runtime ABI, native output, REPL and inventory tests pass
* **Decision**: Add `List.at`, `List.first`, `List.last` returning full-width heap `Option(a)`, `List.take`/`List.drop` clamping their count into `0..=len`, and `Int.parse` accepting exactly `[+-]?[0-9]+` within i64 range as `Option(Int)`. Keep `List.get` and `List.head` as the faulting forms.
* **Context**: The only positional accessors faulted on invalid positions, and no source API converted text to an integer, so ordinary programs either faulted at runtime or pattern-matched around `List.is_empty` and `String.is_decimal`. Fern's error model requires such absence to be a visible `Option`, not a process fault.
* **Consequences**: The runtime encodes `None` as `Err(0)` and `Some` as `Ok(word)` through the existing heap Result helpers, so payloads such as `Int` minimum survive. Negative and oversized counts never wrap. `Int.parse` deliberately rejects whitespace, separators, radix prefixes, exponents and non-ASCII digits; callers normalize text first. The browser target keeps its existing limited runtime surface. See `docs/STDLIB_API_REFERENCE.md`.

### 149 Name the nearest known symbol and the missing cases in diagnostics
* **Date**: 2026-09-14
* **Status**: Adopted; independent checker, parser and suggestion-distance tests pass
* **Decision**: Attach a bounded "did you mean" hint to unknown name, function, constructor, record-field, type and module-member diagnostics using optimal string alignment distance over the visible candidates plus a small synonym table. Report the uncovered constructors or scalar cases in non-exhaustive match errors. Replace parser "unsupported in the Rust prototype" wording with the token actually found.
* **Context**: Misspelled or guessed API names produced the misleading "is private, not exported, or not imported" message, and exhaustiveness errors did not state what was missing. The prototype wording no longer described the shipping compiler.
* **Consequences**: Suggestions are limited to a distance proportional to the name length, a fixed number of candidates and a fixed name length, so diagnostics stay deterministic and cheap. The synonym table covers common names from other languages (`length`, `upper`, `nth`, `to_int`); it does not attempt cross-module suggestions. Missing-case lists are truncated after a fixed count and are informational; the exhaustiveness proof itself is unchanged.

### 148 Expose safe constant arithmetic and retain integer tail parameters in SSA
* **Date**: 2026-09-14
* **Status**: Adopted; independent lowering, native arithmetic, seeded tail-state and paired performance checks pass
* **Decision**: Emit direct native integer division/remainder when the lowered divisor is a known nonzero literal other than `-1`, letting Cranelift apply its existing exact strength reduction. Preserve the helper for zero, `-1` and nonliteral operands. For already eligible direct self-tail functions with all-Int parameters, use typed phi parameters and simultaneous backedge updates after complete source-order argument evaluation. Finalize incoming edges before entry-allocation insertion. Keep managed/mixed parameter storage and capture/defer eligibility unchanged.
* **Context**: The arithmetic benchmark hides its constant divisor behind a general helper and repeatedly stores loop parameters in memory. Constant arithmetic alone is slower on the measured M4; exposing the arithmetic and retaining loop state in registers together reduces 20-million-step elapsed time from 76.60 to 66.57 ms, against Rust's 57.35 ms. The SSA-only control confirms both changes are needed for this measured gain.
* **Consequences**: Integer wrapping, zero faults, operand effects, cleanup and root lifetimes remain required. Independent i128 arithmetic checks cover 113,508 outputs; seeded native recurrence checks cover full-width permutations, multiple backedges, deep iteration and failure/collection paths. No per-iteration call, division or parameter-memory traffic remains in the measured scalar loop. Mixed/managed loops, ordinary non-tail calls, floating-point semantics and WASM retain their existing paths. Dynamic arithmetic and remaining backend instruction selection need separate measurement. See `benchmarks/language-comparison/ARITHMETIC.md`, including the unsuccessful first experiment.

### 147 Optimize native list callbacks under explicit scope and allocation proofs
* **Date**: 2026-09-14
* **Status**: Adopted; staged measurements and independent native, GC, fault and fallback regressions pass
* **Decision**: Emit native code with Cranelift `opt_level=speed`, retaining frame pointers, verifier and conservative memory flags. Validate list bounds once and directly traverse rooted, nonmoving payload storage. Populate only fresh, capacity-proven map/filter builders. Inline statically known native list callbacks with scope-neutral bodies bounded to 64 expression nodes and 64 parameters/captures, using the evaluated environment and enclosing physical root/fault frame. Preserve indirect fallback for dynamic, large, explicit-call, cleanup/control and actor callbacks.
* **Context**: Backend optimization alone barely changes the immutable workload while per-element runtime calls remain. Direct list access improves it about 5–6%; callback inlining supplies the largest gain. Once calls are removed, backend optimization adds another 6–7%. The paired final workload is 2.98–3.71× faster than Decision146, with similar RSS; scalar performance is unchanged and small-source builds grow from about 43 to 45 ms.
* **Consequences**: Source immutability, full-width payloads, callback evaluation order, arithmetic faults and precise roots remain required. General indexing keeps its checked helper; actor continuation boundaries, ordinary calls and Option/Result callback lowering are unchanged. Normal emitter/root budgets remain enforced and excluded bodies use their existing callback activation. Tests prove actual inlining, retained historical versions, precise collection during allocations, short-circuit behavior, fault/defer cleanup and bounded fallback. See `benchmarks/language-comparison/NATIVE_OPTIMIZATION.md`; these measurements do not claim a new collection representation or actor throughput.

### 146 Reuse native callback root registrations without changing immutable values
* **Date**: 2026-09-14
* **Status**: Adopted; independent allocation, native value/ABI and seeded lifetime checks pass
* **Decision**: Store native frames in a reusable vector with nonwrapping monotonic tokens, originating heap identity and stable root ranges. Use push/pop for normal calls; preserve out-of-order and stale-token behavior through a search. Stream only the collected heap's frame ranges into tracing, alongside persistent root registrations. Remove retired heaps' frames before their storage becomes invalid.
* **Context**: Profiling the immutable 256-entry model found repeated insertion/removal in two GC bookkeeping trees dominating callbacks. Most callbacks return an unchanged record, so this cost was paid millions of times without a new record allocation. Repeated callbacks now allocate no bookkeeping after warming to their maximum active depth.
* **Consequences**: The same immutable workload is 2.73–2.94× faster with similar measured RSS. Normal frame operations are amortized O(1), unusual out-of-order exits O(active depth); storage follows peak active depth until invocation shutdown. Lists still map into fresh collections, unchanged records remain shared, actor continuation boundaries and compiler optimization settings are unchanged. Independent retained-version, exact-payload, fault/defer, precise-GC and cross-heap lifetime oracles accompany the change. This is a runtime overhead improvement, not a new collection representation or an actor throughput claim. See `benchmarks/language-comparison/IMMUTABLE.md`.

### 145 Standardize live browser and peer messages on a bounded protobuf profile
* **Date**: 2026-09-14
* **Status**: Adopted; measured prototypes, integrated macOS repository gate and real-browser migration acceptance pass
* **Decision**: Use `fern.live.protobuf.v1` binary WebSocket for the first-party browser and `fern.peer.protobuf.v1` ALPN with peer handshake version 2 between servers. Retain an explicitly negotiated `fern.live.v1` JSON browser compatibility path. Keep HTTP/admin, node configuration, offline records, checkpoints and the native domain bridge in their independently versioned JSON formats. Protobuf does not require gRPC.
* **Context**: The real-browser experiment measures 100-task ASCII snapshot decode including transfer at 26.803/11.071/7.301 µs for JSON/CBOR/protobuf. Protobuf has the smallest complete experiment module; CBOR can encode slightly faster and use fewer bytes. In 7,650 mutations through the real Hub and compiled Fern actor, 100-task round trips remain approximately 2.05 ms ephemeral and 12.9 ms durable across codecs, while protobuf reduces the combined payload by approximately 64%. Measured codec wall-time fractions are not CPU-utilization shares, and the native-domain interval includes actor execution and its JSON bridge rather than isolating either.
* **Consequences**: Explicit field registries, required presence, exact sint64 values and preallocation limits form a shared closed profile. Unknown/duplicate/irrelevant fields reject; generic protobuf decoder defaults alone are insufficient. Stable numbers do not imply rolling upgrades: new schema semantics require explicit negotiation, old peer ALPNs fail, and peers require a coordinated upgrade. Typed command identity, bounded queues, authorization, uncertainty and checkpoint placement remain independent of encoding. Production promotion passed malformed-input simulations, cross-codec local/remote clients, real-browser offline/reconnect and asset integrity, TLS/fault/stress and the complete macOS repository gate. Exact acceptance scope is recorded in the roadmap. See `protocol/README.md`, `docs/WIRE_STANDARD_PROPOSAL.md` and `docs/NETWORK_PROTOCOL.md`.

### 144 Measure codecs separately from transport and delivery semantics
* **Date**: 2026-09-14
* **Status**: Historical baseline; JSON retention superseded by Decision145 after browser and message-path measurements
* **Decision**: Keep bounded JSON over WebSocket for browsers and bounded JSON frames over TLS for peers. Compare native-i64 CBOR and protobuf adapters in an excluded benchmark workspace, preserving real message identities and required fields. Do not introduce gRPC-Web as the bidirectional browser channel.
* **Context**: The current protocol already preserves full-width integers with decimal strings, bounds external records and distinguishes command identity from socket delivery. A smaller encoding does not supply backpressure, reconnection, idempotency or durable acknowledgement. Official gRPC-Web still lacks client/bidirectional streaming; protobuf itself is independent of gRPC.
* **Consequences at this decision**: Forty-six actual message fixtures and explicit malformed-input tests compared bytes and native encode/decode costs. Browser bundle size, allocation and application-path performance were then unmeasured; benchmark codecs stayed outside production. Decision145 records the subsequent browser and compiled-application evidence. The requirement to distinguish codec, transport and delivery effects remains in force.

### 143 Connect fixed room owners through authenticated, bounded forwarding streams
* **Date**: 2026-09-14
* **Status**: Adopted; core simulations, real TLS and three-process fault/stress tests pass
* **Decision**: Configure 1–16 nodes, choose room ownership with versioned rendezvous hashing, and authenticate each browser subscription's peer stream with mutual TLS plus certificate-bound node/boot/manifest identities. Keep ordinary standalone operation and browser WebSocket v1. Bind local checkpoint directories to immutable cluster/node/placement identities while separating certificate/address rotation from placement.
* **Context**: A gateway should reach another server's native room actor without exchanging heap pointers or requiring a broker. A partition cannot safely grant a new owner authority over the same data. Retrying an uncertain mutation into a new process namespace could duplicate a committed effect.
* **Consequences**: Persistent ordered streams carry typed owned commands, bounded outcomes and coalesced snapshots. Limits cover frames, streams, handshakes, ingress and pending commands. Owner-observed transport teardown or lease expiry invalidates delegated capabilities before queued native work executes; a partition can delay observation of gateway logout, and already admitted work may finish. Every replacement stream has a fresh namespace, with explicit browser uncertainty and no automatic mutation replay. Local checkpoint recovery is preserved; dynamic membership, replicated failover, remote language PIDs and distributed transactions remain separate capabilities. The independent stress test drives 10,024 durable mutations through two gateways to a third owner, then exercises balanced owners, slow readers, partitions and restart. See `docs/CLUSTER.md`.

### 142 Compose actor functions through typed returns and ordinary callback identities
* **Date**: 2026-09-14
* **Status**: Adopted; focused native, REPL, inference and independent simulation tests pass
* **Decision**: Infer mailbox effects across lexical direct-call components and refine recursive components before generalization. Permit receiving helpers to return typed values, carrying Result duties through ordinary call summaries. Normalize `with` and `?` into checked control flow, and dispatch ordinary captured callbacks through their original identities into typed actor copies. Give each List callback element an explicit continuation boundary; preserve Option/Result branch selection.
* **Context**: A helper that waits for a value should compose with a caller that handles its Result without a dummy receive or source-order-dependent annotation. A function value should preserve its lexical captures and result ABI while allowing recursive actor work to yield. Treating receiving calls as empty Result provenance would silently discard errors.
* **Consequences**: Spawned initializers still return Unit. Non-tail receiving helpers, strict operands, shared error handlers and collection callbacks preserve full-width values, source evaluation order and logical cleanup under collection. Private list builders stay unpublished until map/filter completion. First-class actor-effect helpers still reject rather than capturing an execution-context pointer. Older REPL closures retain their original checked program through a bounded synchronous fallback; current-program actor callbacks use resumable dispatch. Independent native and interactive models cover branch selection, short-circuit behavior, callback factories, Unicode/Float/Int payloads, sibling progress, cancellation and Result-duty rejection. See `docs/ACTOR_CONTINUATIONS.md` and `docs/REPL_ACTORS.md`.

### 141 Keep actor cleanup attached to logical function activations
* **Date**: 2026-09-13
* **Status**: Adopted; native and REPL lifecycle tests and deterministic scope simulation pass
* **Decision**: Retain a traced cleanup stack per actor. Enter and leave logical source-function scopes across physical callback suspension, register captured Unit cleanup adapters in LIFO order, and drain all remaining scopes during fault retirement or explicit cancellation. Keep cleanup invocation synchronous and reject actor suspension from deferred bodies.
* **Context**: A physical callback may finish while its source function is still waiting for a message. Running `defer` at that callback return would release resources too early; omitting it on cancellation would leak source-level resource lifetimes.
* **Consequences**: Tail callers retain pending cleanup until the callee returns. Return values and deferred captures remain rooted through collection. Cleanup failures do not skip later callbacks and never replace an earlier source fault. Scopes and callbacks share a 4,096-entry admission limit, with retained-byte accounting released on retirement. Independent native and REPL oracles verify receive/return/cancel/fault order, precise collection, admission failure and recovery. A 64-by-256-operation simulation compares runtime scopes against a separate stack model. Blocking or nonterminating native cleanup still requires application discipline; this is not arbitrary instruction preemption.

### 140 Run source actors interactively under deterministic virtual time
* **Date**: 2026-09-13
* **Status**: Adopted; REPL and FernSim transcript/replay tests pass
* **Decision**: Reuse validated actor continuation IR in the Rust interpreter, with a session-owned FIFO scheduler, selective mailboxes, monotonically issued Pids and virtual deadlines. Retain dormant actors and their original checked code across interactive entries. Expose read-only reports, explicit cancellation and a bounded source-transcript FernSim bridge.
* **Context**: Syntax accepted by the compiler should be useful for interactive development and reproducible failure tests. Reimplementing a separate source actor model would drift from native continuation semantics; real sleeps would make short simulations slow and timing-dependent.
* **Consequences**: The virtual clock advances between runnable turns and jumps to the next deadline when idle. New bindings roll back after an entry failure, while already executed actor effects retain their meaning. Restarted actors have new identities; stale Pids stay stale. Limits cover actors, messages, value/code graphs, transcript bytes and evaluator work. Explicit `:stop`, reset, quit and EOF run pending cleanup. Rust embedders explicitly stop a session when source cleanup is required. Three-seed message models and an independent eight-seed supervision/fault/cancellation campaign compare exact output and scheduler state, then replay the reports. See `docs/REPL_ACTORS.md`.

### 139 Execute custom JSON methods inside a shared codec boundary
* **Date**: 2026-09-13
* **Status**: Adopted; focused native, REPL, quota and forced-collection tests pass
* **Decision**: Make `Json(a)` a statically resolved trait with fallible `to_json` and `from_json` methods. Concrete codec plans retain validated function identities; native descriptors use width-preserving callback thunks and an explicit managed-payload flag. Custom wire shapes are opaque to the conservative union and nullability proof.
* **Context**: Derived structural codecs cannot express domain-specific encodings such as string-form user identifiers. Running arbitrary trial decoders would create ambiguous branch priority. Independent callback allowances would let nested or caught failures reset a resource budget.
* **Consequences**: Native and REPL custom methods compose inside structural plans and generic wrappers. Nested JSON operations share work, allocation, node and recursion limits; quota failure in an infallible constructor unwinds cleanup and becomes JSON error 4. Ordinary faults preserve the original fault and unwind callers normally. Explicit error paths compose with their containing JSON pointer. Native callback tests cover scalar widths, full-width integers, managed siblings, forced collection, recursive codecs and recovery after exhaustion. Native callbacks remain ordinary application code, without separate instruction preemption. JSON APIs are not yet part of the portable WASM runtime. See `docs/CUSTOM_JSON.md`.

### 138 Preserve logical call and loop state in typed actor continuations
* **Date**: 2026-09-13
* **Status**: Adopted; native scheduling, ABI and deterministic polling tests pass
* **Decision**: Normalize strict operands once in source order and compile actor-reachable direct helper calls and collection loops into separate continuation functions. Typed return frames support non-tail and mutual recursion without retaining native call stacks. Keep ordinary synchronous function entry points for CLI and non-actor calls.
* **Context**: Unit tail calls alone left recursive value-producing helpers and collection loops able to monopolize a scheduler callback. Calling a nested scheduler from an ordinary native function would retain unbounded native stacks and break ownership.
* **Consequences**: List, Map and Range loops retain immutable state, lexical exits and receive behavior; inclusive maximum endpoints do not overflow. Managed return frames consume explicit resource budgets, while eligible tail calls reuse continuations. Independent tests verify sibling progress, strict operand order, full-width tuple results, Unicode and collection under seeded polling. Blocking foreign/runtime calls still require an asynchronous service adapter. Suspension eligibility and cleanup evolution are documented in `docs/ACTOR_CONTINUATIONS.md`.

### 137 Refine JSON unions with bounded structural evidence
* **Date**: 2026-09-13
* **Status**: Adopted; focused compiler, REPL, native and precise-GC tests pass
* **Decision**: Extend the shared symbolic/concrete wire proof with tuple elements, required record-field children and shared-tag sum payloads. A finite incompatible child proves the alternatives disjoint; recursive pairs are conservatively unresolved. Keep kind and shallow selection first, then inspect borrowed nested shapes only when several candidates remain. Decode the unique selected member once.
* **Context**: Same-key records containing numbers versus strings were rejected even though their wire domains cannot overlap. Trial decoding would introduce arm priority, speculative allocation and inconsistent error reporting. Structural metadata can distinguish these records without executing a decoder.
* **Consequences**: The original aggregate proof and runtime work/depth allowances cover nested traversal. Two optional fields may both be absent; Int/Float, empty Lists and dynamic JSON retain their overlap rules. Existing primitive conversion errors remain unchanged after a unique selection. Every shared sum tag must have disjoint payloads; a common empty constructor remains ambiguous. Independent seeded REPL/native wire oracles cover full-width integers and Unicode; native tests prove allocation-free selection, collection-safe construction and reclamation. Obsolete Int/String record rejection cases now test actual Int/Float overlap, alongside new positive behavior tests.

### 136 Keep foreign ABI and pointer ownership explicit
* **Date**: 2026-09-13
* **Status**: Adopted; source, native ABI, conversion simulation and forced-GC tests pass
* **Decision**: Support `foreign "C" fn ... -> ... as "symbol" from "logical_library"` with exact physical ABI metadata, checked compiler-owned narrow scalar types and sealed `Ptr(a)` handles. String borrows retain their owners; returned pointers conservatively retain owners from pointer arguments, including interior returns. Import UTF-8 through a bounded fallible copy.
* **Context**: The old raw mutable-pointer sketch did not fit Fern's immutable value and actor-isolation model. Rust adapters and mature third-party libraries remain useful, but an unrestricted Int cannot safely stand for both a C integer and a pointer.
* **Consequences**: Foreign declarations are a trusted native boundary. The compiler checks signatures and literal linker names; it cannot prove a foreign library's ABI declaration, address validity, freeing or retention contract. Source code cannot forge addresses, dereference pointers, mutate hidden fields, or send/serialize Ptr values. REPL, comptime and browser execution reject foreign effects. Narrow constructors preserve Result obligations; foreign-returned unsigned 64-bit values retain all bits. Independent tests exercise exact widths, 36 mixed register/stack arguments, 1,024 seeded transports, 4,096 floating bit patterns, real source/library linking and precise-GC owner lifetimes. See `docs/FFI.md`.

### 135 Run portable language values in bounded WASM memory
* **Date**: 2026-09-13
* **Status**: Adopted; focused Wasmi, CLI and deterministic stress tests pass
* **Decision**: Reuse the bounded precise aggregate heap for closures, maps, sets, ranges and unions. Resolve indirect calls through a closed typed dispatch set. Restore roots per loop turn and retain function-owned deferred callbacks in a traced LIFO chain. Propagate language faults through cleanup before reporting a host trap.
* **Context**: The browser application needs ordinary Fern functions and collections, including captured values and cleanup behavior. A separate reduced application language would undermine shared native/browser code.
* **Consequences**: The existing managed i64 host-handle ABI, fixed memory ceilings and capability boundary remain. Language faults and failed cleanup run remaining defers; external host fuel exhaustion or stack cancellation still bypass language cleanup. Generic specializations receive distinct export identities. Independent tests include 1,024 seeded ordered-map transitions, 9,000 closure/GC turns and a deterministic cleanup/fuel oracle. Native host capabilities remain target-specific; see `docs/WASM_LANGUAGE.md`.

### 134 Implement immutable Sets over the existing traced collection representation
* **Date**: 2026-09-13
* **Status**: Adopted; checker, REPL, native simulations and precise-GC tests pass
* **Decision**: Give `Set(a)` a sealed nominal identity with hidden `Map(a, Unit)` storage. Lower thirteen Set operations and membership into checked collection operations, preserving deterministic insertion order and existing key equality.
* **Context**: Sets need distinct source types without a second collector representation or a backend-specific implementation. Exposing the underlying Map would break the abstraction and complicate generic APIs.
* **Consequences**: Set/Map interchange and user construction of hidden storage reject. Current key domains are Int, Bool, String and supported scalar newtypes. Model-based tests check membership, ordering, persistence and full-width keys. Forced collection exposed and fixed the Map.put output-list root across nested pair allocation. A separate Map.keys Result-shape fix gives its fresh key list accurate provenance without acknowledging Results in map values. See `docs/SETS.md`.

### 133 Evaluate constants with the checked language and no host capabilities
* **Date**: 2026-09-13
* **Status**: Adopted; focused checker, REPL, editor and native tests pass
* **Decision**: Parse `const name[: Type] = comptime:` as a value declaration using the ordinary body grammar. After type specialization and Result proof, run its closed initializer in the bounded Rust evaluator and replace it with ordinary typed constant data. Reject unresolved constant types, including unused polymorphic initializers.
* **Context**: Compile-time computation should use Fern's own arithmetic and collection semantics without spawning a native executable or granting the compiler filesystem/network access. Empty unconstrained constants must not become unevaluated generic templates that hide effects.
* **Consequences**: All constants evaluate under shared work/data limits. Host effects, output, actors and foreign calls reject before execution; failures leave the prior REPL session intact. Public annotations, module visibility, formatting and LSP value presentation follow existing conventions. Embedded aggregates may allocate their representation at runtime, but do not rerun their initializer computation. AST reflection, general inline comptime expressions and opaque host resources are outside this constant-data feature. See `docs/COMPTIME.md`.

### 132 Resolve coherent traits statically and derive value behavior explicitly
* **Date**: 2026-09-13
* **Status**: Adopted; checker, native, REPL, WASM and seeded semantic tests pass
* **Decision**: Support single-parameter traits, default methods, parent bounds, explicit `where` requirements and coherent generic implementations. Resolve concrete methods during specialization. Derive Show, Eq, Ord and Clone for supported structural values; keep floating-point and Map ordering absent rather than inventing a total order.
* **Context**: The language design promises reusable checked behavior beyond intrinsic operators. Abstract methods need conservative proof contracts without executable placeholder bodies. Module ownership and overlap checks keep dispatch predictable for library authors.
* **Consequences**: Implementations require ownership of the trait or nominal target, exact method contracts and satisfied requirements. Resolution has shared work/depth bounds. The executable contains ordinary functions, with no runtime dictionaries or trait objects. Abstract function identities remain reserved through closure lifting. Private inference, module visibility, multiple clauses, formatting and generic Result provenance participate in acceptance. See `docs/TRAITS.md`.

### 131 Observe pinned workers without queuing behind their callbacks
* **Date**: 2026-09-13
* **Status**: Adopted; acceptance tracked in the roadmap
* **Decision**: Provide a Rust-rendered, read-only `/admin` dashboard and versioned `/admin/status` JSON response using the preview’s existing session authentication. Publish bounded per-owner snapshots outside native callbacks and read them independently of the worker request queues. Display last-observed counts alongside worker activity and configured admission limits.
* **Context**: The full-stack demo needs inspectable system behavior. Requesting diagnostics through a busy room worker would hide precisely the condition an operator needs to see. A shared preview key does not establish separate administrative roles.
* **Consequences**: Snapshots expose no application contents, identifiers, credentials or filesystem paths. HTML/JSON responses prohibit caching; the offline asset allowlist excludes these routes. Observations across owners are not globally atomic, busy-worker counts can lag, and authentication remains subject to normal ingress admission. A safe native host API also samples OS process resident and peak memory in bytes; platform read failures remain explicit. This adds no server controls, CPU utilization sampling, actor heap introspection or cluster management. The implementation is embedded Rust HTML/CSS with manual refresh and no new dependencies.

### 130 Exercise production boundaries under seeded virtual time
* **Date**: 2026-09-13
* **Status**: Adopted; final integrated acceptance is recorded in the roadmap
* **Decision**: Add an opt-in, invocation-local virtual clock to the native managed runtime and a Rust `fern-sim` package. Drive the production protocol/client state machine and compiled Fern room actors with an ordered, seeded fault schedule, real local checkpoint reopen, independent state checks and a fault-free convergence phase. Separately drive native callback ABI scenarios for selective receive deadlines, sibling progress, supervision, churn and precise collection. Expose both through `cargo xtask simulate` with versioned JSON reports and exact replay.
* **Context**: Studying pinned Phoenix LiveView, Erlang/OTP and TigerBeetle sources clarified three useful boundaries: local interaction versus confirmed server state, callback budgets versus general preemption, and simulated event coverage versus elapsed production time. Fern can exercise its own implementation now without claiming a replicated VM or replacing real browser/OS acceptance.
* **Consequences**: Bounds apply to workload, clients, rooms, event queues and retained trace independently of virtual duration. Reports exclude wall time, paths and native addresses. Simulation is explicitly enabled; package-specific web builds retain the real clock, while workspace feature unification can include dormant simulation state. Failures retain replay configuration and fail the command. The initial campaign exposed an empty decoded-list capture invariant during durable restart; an independent add/remove/reopen regression protects that behavior. A separate forced-collection regression protects session construction roots. Typed JSON constructors now root partially built values across allocation; actor map transfer follows the compiler’s untagged key/value pair ABI, protected by both native descriptor and compiled Fern oracles. Arbitrary preemption, replicated ownership, disk power-loss simulation and complete precise native layouts remain separate work. Source studies and a three-part runnable demo are linked from `docs/DETERMINISTIC_SIMULATION.md`.

### 129 Reuse actor slots and suspend recursive Unit-tail paths
* **Date**: 2026-09-13
* **Status**: Adopted; independent runtime and native progress oracles pass
* **Decision**: Separate reusable actor-table slots from immutable nonwrapping u64 generations. Retain exact dead control identities while PIDs reference them, including PID wrappers in other actor heaps, without retaining dead actor payloads. Compile eligible recursive Unit-returning tail paths into separate resumable actor callbacks while preserving ordinary function/closure calls and the no-actor CLI path.
* **Context**: A 65,536-identity lifetime cap stopped otherwise bounded long-running sessions. Reusing an old control object could revive a stale PID; tracing only the invocation heap could instead free a control identity still referenced by another actor. Explicit PID-to-control metadata edges preserve the immutable identity until the wrapper is swept or its heap retires. Separately, counting callbacks did not interrupt a recursive helper that never returned to the scheduler.
* **Consequences**: Actor completion releases active logical storage and its occupied slot. Old supervision handles resolve their retained lineage without redirecting sends to replacement actors. Churn beyond the former cap, generation exhaustion, stale sends, foreign roots and eventual reclamation have independent tests. Recursive Unit-tail paths through supported blocks, branches, matches and receive arms/timeouts can hand off between callbacks with copied, rooted arguments; native tests cover aliases, mutual recursion, full-width integers and collection at every handoff. Finite helpers and ordinary calls keep their prior behavior. Non-tail/numeric recursion, collection loops, deferred cleanup, `with` and unsupported capture types remain synchronous. Collection and copying are bounded but not yet resumable or charged as instruction work; this is not general preemption.

### 128 Pin room runtimes to workers with shared admission and durable ownership
* **Date**: 2026-09-13
* **Status**: Adopted; deterministic worker and real WebSocket tests pass
* **Decision**: Route rooms by a stable hash to independently owned native runtimes on 1–32 pinned OS threads. Default to available parallelism capped at four. Keep authentication in a separate owner and pass revocable, expiring capabilities to workers. Share one ingress semaphore and RAII room, namespace and connection quotas across all workers. Share durable checkpoints through a Rust-owned locked writer, comparing expected state before each commit.
* **Context**: A single owner serialized all room execution and delayed logout behind application work. Sharing native pointers between threads would violate the collector contract. Independent runtimes allow unrelated room progress while preserving thread ownership; global leases prevent worker count from multiplying process limits. Concurrent checkpoint handles must preserve every room and reject stale owners that could overwrite acknowledged state.
* **Consequences**: Commands within a room retain their owner order. Tests hold one domain callback at a deterministic gate and require another worker and authentication to progress. Logout rejects queued work; an already executing command may finish. Cross-worker reconnect waits for old connection removal, including at capacity. Durable writes serialize at the shared writer and may delay other commits. This establishes bounded room sharding, not general actor preemption, work stealing, live migration, replicated ownership or Erlang-style clustering.

### 126 Execute complete Fern application logic through explicit browser and native host boundaries
* **Date**: 2026-09-13
* **Status**: Adopted; focused native, WebSocket and browser acceptance passes, final integrated gates recorded in the roadmap
* **Decision**: Move the shared checklist domain, immutable model, event update and keyed view into ordinary typed Fern. Extend the separate WASM backend to bounded aggregates with precise pointer layouts and compiler roots. Export managed browser values through positive i64/BigInt handles with checked types and nonwrapping generations; transfer UTF-8 through a bounded scratch region. Rust retains generic DOM, storage and transport capabilities. Compile the native actor adapter to a Cranelift object at build time and link it into the Rust server without a compiler, interpreter or Fern process-startup wrapper.
* **Context**: Executing scalar policy while Rust owned application state did not fulfill the full-stack application boundary. A long-lived host also cannot retain naked Fern pointers across collection or pretend a synchronous native call is an async actor. Native library exports therefore take an explicit fault cell and execution context. Open sessions retain their descriptor/control roots, host PIDs have stable registered roots, and typed String ports copy replies into bounded Rust-owned buffers. A dedicated server owner thread constructs and destroys the native domain without Send implementations for its heaps. Supervised typed actors restart from copied initializer captures within a bounded lifetime budget; stale PIDs remain invalid.
* **Consequences**: The checklist now executes its complete application logic in Fern on both sides. Browser managed handles use 55-bit generations after review found that first-free i32 handle reuse could exhaust in an ordinary long-running UI. Precise nested-value and destructuring-root pressure tests protect that ABI. Native room tests cover isolated state, Unicode, full-width values, fault recovery and 5,000 requests with precise host-root collection. Runtime HTTP and SQLite dependencies are optional and remain enabled by default; the embedded web application uses the core runtime without those unused dependencies. General helper suspension, fair multicore scheduling, full precise native layout coverage, shared wire-schema generation and application-independent framework packaging remain open. These additions do not imply a language 1.0 or Erlang/Phoenix parity.

### 127 Commit bounded room checkpoints before acknowledging shared mutations
* **Date**: 2026-09-13
* **Status**: Adopted; native and real WebSocket restart tests pass
* **Decision**: Offer optional local room-state durability through `FERN_WEB_DATA_DIR`. A single writer owns a bounded checkpoint directory, validates actor replies, atomically publishes room state and syncs file/directory storage before the command gateway acknowledges the mutation. Restore tasks and the next identifier into compiled Fern actors. Restart authentication, revisions and command namespaces under fresh resource incarnations.
* **Context**: Cached browser state is not authoritative durable server state. Replaying uncertain commands across a process restart without retained outcome identity would be unsafe. Room-state checkpoints therefore have a deliberately narrower contract than a durable exactly-once external-effects log. The ephemeral mode remains available when no data directory is configured.
* **Consequences**: Failed application transitions invalidate their incarnation before recovery. A domain reset retires its actor and restores the last acknowledged checkpoint; a failed recovery leaves the room unavailable. Old commands cannot acquire new meaning after a reset. Corrupt/future checkpoints and concurrent writers fail closed. Directory, lock and temporary-file ownership must remain pinned during publication. If publication succeeded but its final directory sync failed, completion is uncertain and the host must not acknowledge it. Multi-node consensus, replicated durable ownership, backups and external-effect transactions are separate gates.

### 125 Deliver a bounded Rust-hosted web preview while retaining full Fern application gates
* **Date**: 2026-09-12
* **Status**: ✅ Adopted; preview foundations implemented
* **Decision**: Deliver the first collaborative checklist with a real compiled Fern WebAssembly policy module, a Rust browser host and service worker, a portable bounded command/snapshot protocol and an authenticated Rust HTTP/WebSocket server. Embed generated browser assets and dependency notices in the executable, with Linux musl targets for static deployment. Preserve the distinction between this working preview and the complete Fern domain-actor/model/update/view architecture in Decision124.
* **Context**: The separate WASM emitter now consumes checked semantic IR, preserving i64 integers and supporting scalar values plus a bounded precise String heap. Native runtime work adds actor-owned payload heaps, copied message/capture graphs and explicit compiler root frames; conservative scanning remains. The browser can execute Fern policy, update keyed accessible DOM through Rust, keep local drafts and reload cached confirmed state offline. The preview's server domain model and client model storage remain Rust. A serialized Rust owner task does not establish fairness or supervision for compiled Fern actors.
* **Consequences**: Generated JavaScript bindings and loading glue remain build artifacts; authored implementation stays Rust and Tree-sitter stays removed. Ordinary CLI programs do not depend on the web packages. The ephemeral protocol distinguishes resource incarnations, resumable namespaces and physical connections, bounds retained outcomes and never blindly replays uncertain mutations into reset state. Real browser checks cover two clients, task changes, filtering, focus, offline reload, drafts, reconnect and logout against an ARM64 static server running unprivileged in an empty Linux chroot. x86-64 static ELF validation does not establish x86-64 execution. Complete typed Fern UI/server integration, precise native root/layout coverage, resumable fairness, typed supervision, multicore scheduling, durability and clustering remain separate gates. See the [preview guide](docs/WEB_PREVIEW.md), [architecture](docs/FULL_STACK_ARCHITECTURE.md) and [roadmap](ROADMAP.md); the earlier native migration report does not validate these new components.

### 124 Prioritize supervised native actors and reactive Fern WebAssembly applications
* **Date**: 2026-09-12
* **Status**: Adopted architecture; implementation gates remain open
* **Decision**: Build toward an integrated Elixir/Phoenix alternative: native server actors, a reactive Fern browser application compiled to WebAssembly, and shared typed WebSocket protocols. Keep ordinary Fern memory management automatic. Prioritize actor-owned tracing heaps, precise roots, copied messages, fair resumable scheduling and typed supervision. Begin browser work with a separate wasm32 ABI and precise linear-memory tracing; evaluate WasmGC before stabilizing that ABI. Inferred ownership, borrowing and reference-counted immutable buffers remain implementation optimizations, not mandatory application-language concepts.
* **Context**: The user explicitly selects the full-stack actor/browser direction. Current actors share an invocation-thread heap, retain message payloads and run cooperatively; those properties do not establish multicore isolation or a long-running server. Native stack/register scanning and LP64 layouts also cannot simply become a browser runtime. This workload prioritizes isolation and latency accounting over a universal Perceus migration.
* **Consequences**: The [full-stack architecture](docs/FULL_STACK_ARCHITECTURE.md) defines authority, memory, fairness, browser bindings, wire compatibility, reconnect/idempotency, overload, supervision and staged scaling. Compiler/runtime/host/tooling remain Rust-authored; application logic is Fern, with generated browser JavaScript interop allowed only as build output. Tree-sitter stays removed. A first-party web/UI framework is separate from mandatory language primitives and CLI dependencies. The first integration target is a bounded, explicitly ephemeral two-browser collaborative checklist; production durability and multicore/multi-node guarantees have separate gates. This decision supersedes any assumption that one reference-counting collector must serve every target, and prioritizes first-party web/UI work over the earlier ecosystem-only framework boundary. It does not mark WASM, HTTP serving, actor isolation or Phoenix parity as implemented.

### 123 Preserve safe native service boundaries during the Rust rewrite
* **Date**: 2026-09-12
* **Status**: Adopted
* **Decision**: Use certificate-verifying ureq/rustls for HTTP, rusqlite for SQLite compatibility, and explicit resource bounds for native text/process/TUI operations. Prefer native Rust while permitting Rust-wrapped third-party native dependencies as authorized.
* **Context**: Reproducing a native buffer overflow or accepting an untrusted certificate is not a useful compatibility requirement. Existing ordinary outputs and error domains remain covered by independent fixtures. The retired C-only string-copy JSON ABI is removed; source JSON uses the validated opaque shared Rust engine.
* **Consequences**: HTTP rejects invalid certificates, redirects, non-2xx status and invalid text, with a 30-second deadline and 16 MiB response cap. TUI rendering is capped at 16 MiB and negative padding is clamped. Both process argv paths enforce 4096 arguments and 1 MiB valid UTF-8 input. These bounded corrections are explicit; the rewrite does not promise to reproduce unsafe or unbounded old behavior. The old 4 MiB frontend budget measured a compiler without embedded Cranelift; new reports identify exact compiler/runtime hashes and do not reuse its measurements.


### 122 Replace the legacy implementation with a Rust workspace
* **Date**: 2026-09-12
* **Status**: Accepted; Rust workspace and release artifacts verified on macOS/Linux ARM64
* **Decision**: Replace all Fern-owned implementation with Rust, use Cranelift as the native backend, remove the C reference compiler and QBE implementation, and organize the project as a Cargo workspace.
* **Context**: The compiler-default migration deliberately retained native C components. The user now explicitly requests a wholly Rust implementation and removal of the old setup, superseding those retention requirements. The user explicitly chose removal of Tree-sitter with retention of the Rust LSP. Rust wrappers around third-party native libraries are allowed, with a preference for native Rust dependencies. Preserve SQLite behavior through its Rust wrapper rather than substituting an incompatible database.
* **Consequences**: Preserve executable language behavior and independent expected-output tests. Use a real Rust-owned nonmoving collector, not allocations retained until process exit; constrain and document unsafe native ABI/OS boundaries. Port process cleanup, quotas, codecs and package validation before retiring their implementations. Replace C-specific style and bootstrap machinery with Rust quality checks. Generated project documentation uses a static accessible module index and browser Find, superseding the authored JavaScript filter in Decision73. Keep historical decisions and measurement records visibly historical; the previous default-migration acceptance does not establish acceptance of this new runtime/backend. Full debug workspace/native gates and selected optimized runtime/ABI boundaries now pass on macOS/Linux ARM64. Both platform archives also pass actual relocated build/run/source-test and installation/uninstall checks, with matching artifact/performance hashes. Exact scope, counts, remaining architecture limits and final artifact evidence are recorded in [Rust workspace acceptance](docs/RUST_WORKSPACE.md).


### 121 Preserve bounded inline value-match arms
* **Date**: 2026-09-12
* **Status**: Accepted for executable source compatibility
* **Decision**: I will accept comma-separated inline value-match arms through the existing patterns, guards, AST and typed lowering, with canonical multiline formatting.
* **Context**: The unchanged C parser/formatter corpus exposed rejection of executable inline matches. Condition-only matches remain indented and with-handlers retain their existing parsing.
* **Consequences**: A comma followed by a balanced pattern/guard segment with a top-level arrow belongs to the nearest unclosed inline match; other commas remain with the enclosing expression. Group a match before a following caller lambda, or a nested match before subsequent outer arms. Parsing never retries based on inferred types. Seven bounded inline tests, thirty existing/tab parser and formatter tests, exact native evaluation-order output and 512 unchanged seeded cases per compiler pass. No new ABI is introduced.

### 120 Preserve consistent tab indentation during compiler migration
* **Date**: 2026-09-12
* **Status**: Accepted for executable source compatibility
* **Decision**: I will accept consistently tab-indented Fern source using eight-column tab stops, preserve byte spans, and keep canonical formatting at four spaces per layout level.
* **Context**: The legacy seeded parser/formatter corpus begins with a valid tab-indented program. Rejecting every tab in Rust broke that executable C-source contract. Decision3 rejects mixed tabs/spaces rather than consistently tab-indented source.
* **Consequences**: Significant code indentation must use one style per source and cannot mix tabs and spaces in a prefix. Blank/comment-only lines and ordinary delimiter continuation whitespace do not select the style; embedded suites do. Horizontal tabs between tokens remain whitespace. Source/token/layout bounds and string/comment contents remain intact. Both default Rust and explicit C reference run the original fuzz smoke corpus; the separate Rust mutation corpus remains required.

### 119 Preserve lookup accountability across denied directory search
* **Date**: 2026-09-12
* **Status**: Adopted for the native bootstrap cache
* **Decision**: I will record an explicit inaccessible-subtree inventory marker only when directory listing and effective-user search both fail with `EACCES`, and create cold-worker artifacts under a private `umask 077`.
* **Context**: Linux's ordinary `umask 002` made generated metadata group-writable and therefore correctly rejected by the private-cache validator. After isolating the worker mask, recursive library inventories reached `/usr/lib/ssl/private`, whose root-owned target denied search. Rejecting that unrelated subtree prevented the quality checker from starting; silently ignoring unreadable directories would hide headers that a compiler can still open by known name.
* **Consequences**: Use `faccessat` with `AT_EACCESS` on Linux and macOS. Re-evaluate the marker on every cache lookup so gained access changes the inventory. Unreadable-but-searchable directories and other access errors still reject; fixed traversal bounds and cycle checks remain. Worker-only permissions do not alter the final checker's caller mask. Red-first permission-transition tests pass with private debug, release and sanitizer helpers on both platforms; cold-cache and caller-mask regressions cover `002` and `000`/`002`/`027` respectively.

### 118 Retain separate measured compiler budgets during default migration
* **Date**: 2026-09-12
* **Status**: Accepted; both platform release budgets verified
* **Decision**: I will retain the C reference compiler's 1,500,000-byte ceiling and require the expanded Rust default to fit 4 MiB, with the existing 150-second build and 100-ms startup-p95 ceilings unchanged. Use ThinLTO and one codegen unit with normal release optimization.
* **Context**: The full typed frontend, Result proof engine, native testing, editor tools and terminal editor measured about 4.3 MiB with stock release settings, 3.6 MiB with ThinLTO, and 3.1 MiB with size optimization plus ThinLTO on macOS arm64. The original compiler-size ceiling measured the narrower C compiler, not generated Fern applications. Removing implemented language guarantees to match that earlier compiler would defeat the migration.
* **Consequences**: Both compiler budgets remain enforced independently by mise run perf-budget. Prefer normal optimization over the smaller size-optimized build; measure actual frontend/native workflows and validate both platform releases before promotion. These compiler budgets make no new claim about generated-program size, static linking, or universal performance. Cargo source dependencies and native components remain visible in the release and notices.

### 117 Ship the Rust compiler as fern with explicit native components
* **Date**: 2026-09-12
* **Status**: Accepted; default promotion verified on macOS/Linux arm64
* **Decision**: I will make the verified Rust frontend the default `fern`, retain the C frontend as `fern-c`, and distribute the QBE helper, native test supervisor and shared runtime beside them. A `fern-package.json` marker disables implicit development-checkout fallback for installed packages.
* **Context**: Decision96 authorizes the compiler migration after compatibility and platform gates. Replacing one executable without installing its required native helpers would produce a package that only works inside the checkout. Existing release recipes and installation tests describe the older C-only bundle.
* **Consequences**: Build, install, uninstall, archive and CI contracts must cover every component and execute real Rust-language applications outside the checkout. Missing helpers fail visibly even when a development checkout exists. Explicit component overrides remain supported. C bootstrap and legacy ABI tests remain separate required references. This compiler migration does not imply rewriting QBE, the runtime, supervisor or editor parser in Rust, or completing unrelated future language features. Switch defaults only after executable language/API/tooling acceptance, Result proofs and Linux/macOS release gates pass.

### 116 Preserve executable C source operations through typed Rust lowering
* **Date**: 2026-09-12
* **Status**: Accepted for migration compatibility
* **Decision**: I will preserve the shipping service aliases, bracket list indexing and infix membership through existing runtime identities and checked typed operations. Membership retains needle-before-list evaluation order.
* **Context**: A complete 212-name registration inventory and C lowering audit found these concrete executable compatibility gaps. Parser-only constructs and known C miscompilations are not valid native-output references.
* **Consequences**: Indexing shares List.get fault, full-width transport and Result-obligation rules; formatting canonicalizes it to List.get. Membership keeps IEEE comparisons and scalar Contains requirements. Native tests cover both backends, exact C reference outputs where valid, source order and deferred fault cleanup. Rust retains documented JSON, Option and error-handling corrections. Full future-language features remain distinct from compiler migration acceptance; see docs/LANGUAGE_PARITY.md.

### 115 Complete CLI and interactive-tool compatibility with safe Rust
* **Date**: 2026-09-12
* **Status**: Accepted; compiler/tooling platform acceptance verified
* **Decision**: I will preserve public fern identity, literal source operands, default documentation discovery and REPL inspection/editing behavior in the Rust default. Use exactly pinned Rustyline18.0.1 with only file-history support enabled for terminal editing.
* **Context**: Failing compatibility and real-PTY tests demonstrated missing command delimiters, inspection commands, editing, completion and persistent history. Standard safe Rust does not supply a readline terminal editor; a maintained dependency avoids adding custom unsafe terminal control.
* **Consequences**: Piped execution keeps its existing bounded state machine and quiet output. Type inspection has no runtime effects, Ctrl-C cancels pending input without losing prior state, and history import has explicit byte/entry limits and rejects nonregular inputs. Package the dependency notices. The C developer shell-command test overrides remain explicit bootstrap-only facilities; Rust executes source tests directly. Semantic LSP actions publish real versioned edits, reject ambiguous bindings and negotiate client support for documentChanges, prepareRename and literal actions. See docs/TOOLING_PARITY.md for the tested command matrix and limits.

### 114 Prove bounded recursive Result builder contracts
* **Date**: 2026-09-12
* **Status**: Accepted; bounded contracts and platform gates verified
* **Decision**: I will prove finite fresh-output and complete-input-retention contracts for recursive Result builders, preserving exact aliases first and never granting provisional handling credit.
* **Context**: Alias-only recursive summaries reject useful finite recursive values. Assuming recursive calls consume their inputs would instead permit silent error loss. Inductive retention summaries allow construction without assuming handling.
* **Consequences**: Successful exits must retain all promised duties; fresh obligations remain separate. List and nominal accumulators, optional payloads, generics and mutual recursion share a bounded proof engine. Widened groups rebuild dependent summaries within the original 400,000-step budget. Opaque nominal cuts do not prove descent or nonempty collections. Unknown-key Map overwrite, consuming/replacing accumulators and arbitrary higher-order equations remain conservatively rejected. See docs/RESULT_HANDLING.md.

### 113 Close SQLite handles explicitly and bound live connections
* **Date**: 2026-09-12
* **Status**: Accepted for the shared native runtime and both compiler frontends
* **Decision**: I will expose `sql.close(handle) -> Result(Int, Int)`, bound live connections at 256, and reuse storage without reusing handle identities.
* **Context**: Native programs could open and execute SQLite statements but could not release connections or locks. An ever-growing handle table does not provide a usable lifecycle for long-running programs. Keeping monotonically assigned IDs prevents a stale handle from accessing a later connection.
* **Consequences**: Successful close returns `Ok(0)`; unknown, closed, or invalid handles return the existing IO error. A failed SQLite close retains the connection for retry. Live quota or ID exhaustion returns the existing out-of-memory error before opening a database. Close rolls back outstanding transactions according to SQLite semantics. Both C and Rust native paths share the implementation; SQL remains explicitly unavailable in the REPL. Debug/release/sanitizer and source-output tests cover quotas, recycling, stale handles, transactions and lock release. Typed query APIs remain separate work.

### 112 Integrate Cranelift through shared typed machine lowering
* **Date**: 2026-09-06
* **Status**: Accepted for implementation and opt-in acceptance testing; default promotion requires the backend gates
* **Decision**: I will extract the existing semantic lowering into a bounded typed machine representation, render QBE from it, and emit native objects with pinned Cranelift0.135.1 from the same representation. This supersedes the standard-library-only dependency restriction for the optional Cranelift backend, not for unrelated compiler code.
* **Context**: The user requested completing the Cranelift integration. The isolated scalar experiment does not exercise Fern's closures, cleanup, runtime ABI or actors. Translating emitted QBE text would retain the coupling and introduce another language parser. Canonical runtime signatures must retain actual result widths even when callers discard or narrow values; Float formatting needs fixed-signature runtime entry points.
* **Consequences**: Keep safe Rust at the compiler boundary, dated nightly and locked dependencies. Preserve independent expected-output tests and QBE as the reference until full native, GC, ABI, debugger and performance acceptance. Cranelift replaces the C code generator, not the C runtime, external libraries, native supervisor or generated editor parser. Python correctness oracles remain developer tooling. Record precisely which gates pass before changing defaults; do not equate an integrated backend with a Rust-only runtime.

### 111 Use an explicitly dated nightly for Fern development and CI
* **Date**: 2026-09-06
* **Status**: Accepted; supersedes the Rust1.75 preservation policy in Decisions45/106/107/109
* **Decision**: I will use nightly-2026-09-06, with its rustfmt, Clippy and rust-src, through both mise and a matching root rust-toolchain.toml. The user explicitly requested nightly; do not retain an unsupported Rust1.75 compatibility promise.
* **Context**: The official nightly manifest provides Rust1.100.0-nightly and the required components on Linux/macOS arm64/x86-64. A date pin preserves repeatable tool selection while allowing deliberate future upgrades. Current Cranelift does not require nightly, but the new policy removes the old frontend-toolchain obstacle. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by this established format.
* **Consequences**: Keep edition2021 and standard-library-only production dependencies. Cargo's numeric rust-version1.100 is a minimum version check, not a claim that an untested stable compiler is supported; the dated nightly is the tested build policy. Compare active compiler, Cargo, formatter and Clippy identities with the installed pinned toolchain, require rust-src, and test pin drift. Migrate renamed lints with real negative fixtures and fix new diagnostics without broad policy suppression. A local large_enum_variant allowance preserves the public statement IR; boxing it requires a separate allocation/layout audit. Bacon's jobs follow Fern nightly; its installer and the Zed component retain their independent stable pins. Preserve historical benchmark evidence. Revalidate native behavior, cleanup, docs and developer tools before recording this migration complete. Nightly adoption does not itself implement or select a Cranelift backend.

### 110 Package the Rust frontend as an explicit relocatable preview
* **Date**: 2026-09-06
* **Status**: Accepted for opt-in staging and verification; shipping defaults unchanged
* **Decision**: I will stage explicit already-built Rust/native components into a new immutable directory and atomically publish one completely verified archive. Preserve exactly seven sibling files and a closed, bounded canonical manifest/archive format.
* **Context**: Users need to try the expanded Rust frontend outside its source checkout. Portable nonempty directory replacement is not atomic, and checkout fallback can conceal incomplete packages. Failing package/marker/native-relocation tests preceded implementation. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by this established format.
* **Consequences**: A sibling preview marker disables implicit checkout fallback even when malformed; explicit component overrides remain supported. Bound actual reads, decompression, metadata and precharged payload copies; reject links, aliases, extra paths and malformed archives before publication. Reproducibility covers identical package inputs with the same packaging toolchain, not native compilation or publisher authentication. Native compilation still requires matching host libraries. No installation, signing, publication or default switch is implied. See [the runnable packaging guide](docs/history/RUST_PREVIEW_PACKAGING.md).

### 105 Execute bounded typed actors through explicit native continuations
* **Date**: 2026-09-06
* **Status**: Accepted for native105A; generalized suspension and supervision remain open
* **Decision**: I will use invocation-owned cooperative actors with invariant typed mailboxes, selective receive, one-time monotonic deadlines and compiler-owned continuation frames. Keep ordinary environment/fault ABI unchanged and pass a separate execution context to managed calls; native callback status and payload are int64/QBE `l`.
* **Context**: Rust actor syntax must execute with defined ownership and scheduling rather than remain a type-checking placeholder. Source/native tests and independent runtime/public-IR probes exposed descriptor-budget, timestamp, root-retirement and pre-lowering validation defects, which require fixes before publication. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by this established format.
* **Consequences**: Validate original and inactive public IR before conversion erases type evidence; cap generated identities. Spawn queues work, send borrows values and returns Result(Unit,Int), and locally owned Result duties survive suspension without handling credit. Retire spent roots and preserve unmatched messages under explicit live/identity/mailbox/retained-byte/work limits. Timely queued matches remain eligible after delayed polling; late or equal-deadline arrivals cannot defeat timeout. Receiving-owned defer, non-tail/indirect suspension, typed supervision and REPL/FernSim execution remain explicitly unsupported. Existing C actor/lifecycle APIs retain their separate contract. See [the complete source, ABI, quota and failure policy](docs/RUST_ACTORS.md).

Phase measurements found redundant actor preparation in ordinary programs. Preserve every original public-IR check, reuse immutable validated layouts/effects, and borrow the program when no continuation functions are appended. Revalidate the combined tree when functions are added. Select byte-identical ordinary or actor fault support. The [paired Criterion record](benchmarks/compiler-phases/actor105-preparation-review.json) documents the measured recovery and remaining cost; shared-host phase timings are not end-to-end or native execution guarantees.

### 108 Preserve common CLI controls during Rust migration
* **Date**: 2026-09-06
* **Status**: Accepted for common output controls, bounded syntax inspection and documentation opening (108A–C)
* **Decision**: I will parse bounded global quiet/verbose/color controls before subcommand dispatch while retaining literal option operands and all run arguments after `--`.
* **Context**: A C/Rust command audit and failing regressions found missing common controls and an incorrect successful status for a missing command. The existing std-only parser can preserve the compatibility contract without a dependency change.
* **Consequences**: Quiet hides check/build/test summaries and interactive prompts; errors, explicit help/version, generated data and native program streams remain visible. Verbose identifies the selected command on stderr. Color applies only to human compiler/test output; auto checks its actual terminal destination and NO_COLOR, while explicit always wins. `-v` aliases version. Bound arguments at 4096 words/1 MiB before dispatch, preserve non-UTF8 operands, and return status 1 for a missing action. Rust emit-output/fmt-check extensions remain. 108B adds source-only lex/parse inspection of the actual Rust token/AST representation. Preserve source/token/depth limits, check a 1 MiB byte read before UTF-8 decoding, and format into a 16 MiB bounded buffer before publication. Dump text is escaped and uncolored, not stable serialization or C byte parity; no module loading, typing or execution occurs. Parser/limit errors publish no partial dump, while a physical output failure cannot roll back already written bytes. 108C makes --open imply HTML, retaining explicit output or fern-docs.html in the current directory before invoking the fixed platform opener with one canonical absolute OS path. Failures remain visible best-effort notes after successful generation. The launcher has null streams and a ten-second polling deadline; timeout stops and reaps only that owned child, with kernel-uninterruptible waits explicitly outside the bound. All documentation modes check raw source bytes against 1 MiB per file and 8 MiB aggregate before UTF-8 decoding. Default installation remains later scope. Source/runtime semantics and the shipping compiler are unchanged.

### 107 Incremental Rust lint and benchmark guidance
* **Date**: 2026-09-06
* **Status**: ✅ Adopted
* **Decision**: I will enforce tested MSRV-compatible lints, audit strict restrictions module by module, and measure compiler phases in an independently locked Criterion developer package.
* **Context**: The attached review guidance calls for practical safety checks and developer tools while preserving the existing project contracts.
* **Consequences**: Adopt eight MSRV-compatible package Clippy restrictions, production panic restrictions,
and a stricter audited source-directory module. Test lint names and enforcement with
real offline negative crates. Keep validated bounded arithmetic narrowly documented.
Reject oversized initial source paths before allocation/filesystem lookup. Later audited native linker and frame modules receive the same restrictions. Preserve nonbreaking-space path bytes with ASCII shell delimiters; reject NUL and over-budget linker records/words/argument counts before parser allocation. Checked frame access/conversion preserves the existing protocol and lifecycle, including all 256 exit codes; no frame semantic defect was found. The pkg-config library-directory record has a separate borrowed-path decoder: preserve literal whitespace and remove only one LF/CRLF terminator; reject empty, non-UTF-8, NUL, multiline or over-4096-byte paths before archive lookup. Malformed successful metadata must not select a lossy/trimmed/current-directory decoy or silently use the --libs fallback. Unavailable or unsuccessful pkg-config retains the existing fallback.

Add Criterion 0.5.1 in an independent unpublished developer workspace with an exact
Rust1.75-tested dependency lock. Measure parsing, checking, QBE emission and actual
codec validation, with independently verified fixtures and black_box. Keep compiler
production dependencies and lock unchanged. CI smoke checks behavior; statistical
baselines are optional and cannot alone establish performance improvement.

Use the Decision106 mise workflow and its tested optional tools, not Nix/devenv or
a new Justfile. Preserve the production MSRV and exact CLI semantics (Decision108
owns any CLI parser change). docs/RUST_GUIDANCE.md records every attached suggestion,
its adoption/omission rationale and remaining boundary. No unrelated product crate,
global tool installation, native runtime changes, or automatic dependency updates.

### 106 Reproducible development tasks with mise
* **Date**: 2026-09-06
* **Status**: ✅ Adopted
* **Decision**: I will use mise as the maintained development environment and task runner, preserving Rust 1.75 and isolating optional newer developer tools.
* **Context**: The user requested reproducible onboarding and broad adoption of the Rust review guidance without Nix/devenv.
* **Consequences**: Adopt mise as the sole maintained task/environment entry point, replacing Justfile and mask. Keep existing task names and native gate commands; run composite clean/build/consumer steps sequentially, and set default task jobs to one. No Nix/devenv configuration is introduced.

Pin the required tools to Rust1.75.0 (rustfmt, Clippy, rust-src), Python3.14.7 (the existing CPython3.14 reference contract) and uv0.12.5. CI pins mise2026.9.1 and immutable mise-action commit c2a87611a18de5b3828c5652fe268e992400cb5c. Mise configuration accepts this version or newer. Pin binary-download URLs and SHA256 values on Linux/macOS x64/arm64; use strict config-scoped locking. Rust remains a rustup-backed version pin verified by its distribution mechanism, not a mise URL lock. The three Python reference-script graphs have uv script locks and enforced --locked execution; stale metadata fails without running scripts or updating locks. Native packages/SDKs remain host-managed inputs, not a reproducible OS image or offline build claim.

Centralize authored C configuration in scripts/build_config, consumed by task scripts and the existing bounded native checker bootstrap. Keep its source snapshot, compiler-profile rejection, content/dependency cache validation and supervisor lifecycle unchanged. The checker itself does not execute Python/Cargo; mise may provision configured project tools before any task. Direct scripts/check_style execution remains available with only native dependencies.

Expose focused non-writing Rust formatting, locked all-target/all-feature checking, Clippy warnings-as-errors, tests and documentation tests. The editor baseline uses an explicitly installed Rust Analyzer editor extension plus rust-src; no extension is installed silently. Preserve Zed package Rust1.97.1 through a task-local process scope so the project Rust1.75 environment cannot override its component toolchain.

Provide opt-in nextest0.9.143 (prebuilt, four threads, no retries) and watchexec2.7.1 (explicit project origin, literal queued cargo-check command). Required CI retains cargo test and documentation tests. Provide optional Bacon3.25.0 check/Clippy UI: its installer uses a separately pinned Rust1.98.1 and cargo install --locked into compiler-rs/target/dev-tools/bacon-3.25.0; its actual project jobs explicitly select Rust1.75. No global executable/default or application dependency changes. This source build and extra compiler are opt-in, not ordinary setup requirements.

Keep historical decisions and published measurements unchanged. Update active guidance, CI, release/developer scripts, compiler help and bootstrap workflow to mise. Cargo-generate/cargo-seek have no concrete existing workflow here and are not installed speculatively. Decision107 supplies the verified rust-lint-policy, rust-bench-smoke and rust-bench tasks and a separate developer dependency lock.

Verification includes real runner dependency serialization, literal source/config/installation paths, fail-fast native task dispatch, pin mismatch rejection, all platform lock records, optional toolchain separation, and the existing bootstrap/native workflow gates. Mise provisioning installs the configured rust-src component for the pinned project toolchain. Fresh Linux tools and the combined macOS/Linux Rust, native, cache, documentation and nextest gates passed. Literal quoted build flags and pkg-config paths use a bounded non-evaluating decoder, tested across all build helpers and generated roundtrips.


### 109 Reevaluate native backends with measured user workflows
* **Date**: 2026-09-06
* **Status**: Assessment accepted; production backend and compiler MSRV unchanged
* **Decision**: I will pursue a supported Cranelift AOT trial against the shared validated semantics and independent native oracle corpus before choosing a new default. Keep QBE as the working reference and do not select unsupported Cranelift solely to preserve Rust1.75.
* **Context**: The user requested reassessment after the Rust frontend decision. Decision1 incorrectly described QBE as emitting C: it emits target assembly. An isolated current-Cranelift experiment produces correct native scalar output and suggests that direct object emission can remove assembler overhead. It is not an end-to-end Fern performance or compatibility result. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by this established format.
* **Consequences**: A production trial must settle the supported stable toolchain policy, extract shared semantic lowering and fixed-signature runtime calls, and verify all native widths/layouts/faults/defers/GC paths. Current Cranelift requires a newer compiler toolchain; a Rust frontend itself does not require a Rust backend. Debug data, Apple object-unwind support and a future browser-WASM target require separate work. The measured scalar runtime speeds are similar; no general generated-code speed claim follows. See [the sourced assessment, measurements and acceptance plan](docs/history/BACKEND_REASSESSMENT.md).

### 103 Encode explicitly derived sums with stable source tags
* **Date**: 2026-09-06
* **Status**: Accepted for tagged sums and conservatively disjoint union codecs (J6a–J6b)
* **Decision**: I will encode derived sum values as a strict object with `tag` and `fields`, using original unqualified constructor spelling and source-order payloads. Validate the complete envelope before converting payloads; unknown variants use code13 at `/tag`.
* **Context**: The proposal and failing native/REPL/public-plan tests preceded implementation. Constructor ordinals and runtime storage are not stable wire identities. Finite recursive schemas need an OR of constructor products, checking all stored components, including inactive variants. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by this established format.
* **Consequences**: Independent variant-name layout metadata validates source identity. The four-word native descriptor uses a narrowly typed children/variants pointer union; kind12 points to three-word variant descriptors. This external ABI exception does not fabricate language tuple layouts. Every envelope node and payload spends the existing shared native/REPL limits. Plan validation charges metadata and finite-value proof before publication, including inactive entries. Constructor rename/payload reorder changes the wire format. Result/function payloads remain unsupported; phantom arguments remain irrelevant. J6b uses canonical union plans and precharged shallow kind/key/length/tag profiles, validated independently even in inactive plans. Select exactly one member before decoding; no trial conversion or candidate allocation. Code14 reports no unique member at the current path. Known overlaps reject even alongside symbolic types; whole-union and exact String-key requirements survive until independently inferred specialization. Non-union signature evidence resolves before exact union equations, without a witness or directional-subtyping bypass. Inline union-bearing decoder targets reuse the existing type grammar and canonical codec identity, including nested containers and generic types. Lazy linear token metadata bounds recognition without repeatedly scanning ordinary nested expressions; ordinary calls, closures, formatting and source identities retain their existing behavior. Deeper value discrimination and general/custom traits remain open (J6c–J7). See [the codec contract](docs/JSON_TYPED_CODECS.md).

### 102 Retain native test identity until descendant cleanup is complete
* **Date**: 2026-09-06
* **Status**: Accepted for the native helper and safe Rust adapter
* **Decision**: I will supervise native unit/doc tests with a separate trusted native component that retains the child with WNOWAIT through group cleanup, then reaps exactly that child. Safe Rust receives a bounded versioned binary frame and never signals numerical test process groups or creates detached stream-reader threads.
* **Context**: The old adapter observed/reaped a child with try_wait before invoking external group kill; ownership of that numerical group could already have ended. Escaped pipe holders could also strand detached readers. Source-validated failing lifecycle/protocol tests preceded the replacement. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by this established format.
* **Consequences**: The helper owns private fixed spools, held file identities, bounded nonblocking capture/publication and cleanup. Rust retains the taken stdin liveness guard through wait, validates canonical fields, complete lengths/trailer/EOF and helper status, and removes only its empty private parent. Each stream is capped at256KiB; positive test deadlines up to60s initiate cleanup, followed by a1s publication allowance. Kernel waits and escaped groups have explicit limits. Native exit125 remains a test status, separate from transport failure. Debug/Rust-release builds include fern-test-supervisor; missing/incompatible helpers fail with no fallback. The standalone OS ABI uses fixed bounded storage without Fern GC or authored dynamic allocation. Existing language Result/test APIs remain unchanged.

### 104 Respect Apple arm64 reserved registers in the shared backend
* **Date**: 2026-09-06
* **Status**: Accepted for the Apple arm64 QBE target
* **Decision**: I will reserve IP1/x17 in the Apple allocator and use it for every integer swap/spill scratch path. Keep x18/w18 unavailable, as required by [Apple's ABI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/writing-arm64-code-for-apple-platforms). Generic arm64/Linux keeps its original allocation and scratch convention.
* **Context**: A stalled native checker had crashed while dereferencing a tuple; its generated return path used reserved x18. An assembly invariant and controlled scalar clobber test independently reproduced the ABI defect before the fix. The sample does not establish the exact crash trigger, and no separate GC or tuple-lifetime defect was identified. Fern imported this vendored QBE source in commit `217960c40ab7e434750e7111f4c8d3277933db3b`; that import records no upstream release/tag. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by this established format.
* **Consequences**: Allocator global masks/counts and all integer scratch emission agree; caller-save filtering preserves the dedicated scratch and Float scratch remains v31. Apple assembly contains no x18/w18 for swaps, forty live values, calls and constant spills. Independent native outputs pass on macOS/Linux; generic Linux assembly is byte-identical. Twenty fresh native checker scans produce identical output. This is stability evidence, not proof of the original crash cause. C and Rust share the corrected backend; launcher, GC, recursion and timeout behavior are unchanged.

### 101 Build finite recursive JSON plans and extend explicit derivation coherently
* **Date**: 2026-09-06
* **Status**: Accepted staged continuation; J5a recursive records, J5b newtypes and J5c conditional requirements
* **Decision**: I will represent recursive codecs as finite indexed graphs keyed by exact instantiated types, reserve private construction slots before visiting children, and publish only complete validated plans. Reject strict schema cycles with no finite value as a codec restriction; Lists, Maps and safe Options provide finite bases.
* **Context**: J4's acyclic plans reject ordinary trees even when empty children terminate recursion. Disabling the child-first check without graph validation would admit invalid references, skipped fields and unbounded generic expansion. An explicit graph preserves source nominal identity without recursively owning plan nodes. The proposal and failing tests preceded implementation; the unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by this established format.
* **Consequences**: Validate every entry, typed edge and storage layout, including inactive entries; graph construction and finite-value proof share the existing work/count bounds. Every executed edge retains depth/work/path charges, including hostile cyclic native values. Native descriptor ABI is unchanged. J5b adds explicitly derived transparent newtypes, inherits payload nullability while retaining actual Option field optionality, and proves no native wrapper allocation. J5c retains conditional Json, JsonNonNull and exact JsonStringKey requirements through generic source schemes, recursive calls and function values. An unforgeable private template operation retains real input effects; all executable boundaries reject that operation. Concrete specialization checks the exact target again, with no default witness. Requirements follow actual stored fields, not phantom metadata; predicate and template passes retain separate shared 400,000-work bounds. Sum/union wire formats, general/custom traits and Result serialization remain separate decisions/work.

### 100 Expose canonical formatting through the editor protocol
* **Date**: 2026-09-06
* **Status**: Accepted for full-document Rust LSP formatting
* **Decision**: I will advertise `documentFormattingProvider` and handle `textDocument/formatting` using the accepted current open buffer and the existing syntax/comment-preserving formatter. Return no edits for canonical source or one whole-document UTF-16 replacement for changed source.
* **Context**: The CLI formatter was available but editors could not request it. The [LSP formatting contract](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_formatting) separates proposed edits from client application. Seven failing protocol tests preceded implementation; an additional executable test verifies the actual CLI transport without native backend dependencies.
* **Consequences**: Formatting does not read disk imports, change accepted buffers/versions, publish diagnostics or write files. Syntax errors return RequestFailed (-32803); malformed options and unopened documents return InvalidParams (-32602), with existing lifecycle errors preserved. Validate standard option types, a positive protocol uinteger tabSize and scalar extension values, while retaining Fern's canonical four-space style regardless of whitespace preferences. Existing source/frame bounds apply. The client applies edits to the corresponding snapshot. Range/on-type formatting, rename and code actions remain separate. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by this established format.

### 99 Format source directories after complete input validation
* **Date**: 2026-09-06
* **Status**: Accepted for the Rust formatter
* **Decision**: I will support an explicit source directory in `fern-rs fmt` and `fmt --check`, using the same bounded source discovery as documentation commands. Validate every source and stage every changed file with its original permissions before publishing any replacement.
* **Context**: The design specifies `fern fmt src/`, but the Rust CLI treated directories as files. Formatting files as they are discovered would leave a partially formatted project after a later syntax or staging error. The proposal was recorded before eight failing CLI tests; implementation makes those tests pass and preserves the six existing file-check regressions.
* **Consequences**: Discovery skips hidden/build/dependency directories and child symlinks, sorts source paths, and limits depth to 32, entries to 8192, files to 256 and paths to 4096 bytes. Explicit root symlinks remain supported. Input is limited to 1 MiB per file and 8 MiB per invocation; formatted output also has an 8 MiB aggregate cap. Check mode reports all dirty paths without staging or changing bytes, permissions, inode identities or modification times. Preparation failure preserves all originals; publication uses atomic per-file renames and is not a directory-wide transaction. An OS rename error may follow earlier completed replacements. No concurrent-editor transaction, implicit path selection or watch mode is promised. Twelve new boundary/CLI/staging regressions cover these rules. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by this established format.

### 98 Derive explicit typed JSON codecs with bounded shared execution
* **Date**: 2026-09-06
* **Status**: Accepted for concrete acyclic codecs (J4)
* **Decision**: I will provide `json.encode(value)` and `json.decode(text, TargetType)` as uniformly fallible operations, with explicit `derive(Json)` on nominal records. Decode's target is a compile-time type reference; input pipes retain source evaluation order. Native and interactive execution share concrete validated wire plans and the existing exact JSON adapters.
* **Context**: Dynamic JSON required manual field conversion and did not establish a typed record boundary. Inferring serialization from storage would silently encode Result obligations and leave unknown-field, nullability and generic behavior unspecified. Parser/checker, public-IR, native-output, REPL and resource-boundary tests preceded implementation. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by this established format.
* **Consequences**: J4 supports primitives, dynamic JSON, tuples, Lists, String-key Maps, nullable-safe Options and acyclic derived records, including concrete generic instances. Reject Result-bearing values, unsupported derivations even when unused, ambiguous nullable Options and runtime decode targets. Records reject unknown fields (code12); absent safe Option fields become None, while required fields fail with code6. Errors retain stable codes/offsets and an immutable JSON Pointer; path-growth failure reports the last entered parent. Each call shares input/output/allocation/node/depth/work limits across every phase and child. Public plans validate inactive entries and bodies under one 400,000-unit allowance; native descriptor output is capped at 16 MiB. The authored runtime include belongs to source fingerprints. Recursive schemas, newtypes, generic codec constraints, sum/union wire formats and general/custom traits remain J5–J7, not implicit behavior. C keeps its legacy JSON source and ABI contract. See [the typed codec contract](docs/JSON_TYPED_CODECS.md).

### 97 Stop supervised descendants before fallible exit notifications
* **Date**: 2026-09-06
* **Status**: Accepted for deterministic mailbox lifecycle; actor execution remains open
* **Decision**: I will stop the complete owned descendant subtree before any exit notification can fail. Descendants receive shutdown semantics, and surviving external observers receive root-first notifications in child registration order. A child cannot restart under a dead owner.
* **Context**: Supervisor exits left descendants alive and schedulable, including after notification allocation failures. Recursive exit calls would introduce stack limits and restart children during parent shutdown. Additional allocation tests reproduced spawn accepting a failed name copy and restart publishing a live orphan before monitor storage failed.
* **Consequences**: A bounded allocation-free iterative ownership walk clears lifecycle, current-context and scheduler state before notifications. The first notification failure is returned; later notifications and automatic restarts are not promised after failure. Normal/shutdown exits do not automatically restart. Existing abnormal direct-owner strategies may replace the root, but do not rebuild its former child subtree or reparent old children. Prepare actor names and replacement monitor storage before ID publication; the existing fatal heap-Result wrapper allocation policy is unchanged. Ten subtree/failure groups and six prior lifecycle scenarios pass debug/release/sanitizers on macOS/Linux arm64. Actor execution, ancestor escalation, subtree reconstruction and the million-step FernSim target remain separate. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by this established format.

### 96 Concentrate new language features in Rust and retain C as a bootstrap reference
* **Date**: 2026-09-06
* **Status**: Accepted migration direction; default command migration remains unverified
* **Decision**: I will complete new source-language features in Rust, then retain the C frontend as an explicitly selected bootstrap/reference executable after the Rust default passes its migration gates. I will preserve tested legacy native ABI symbols without duplicating every new source feature in C.
* **Context**: Decisions45/46 retain C as the shipping default during validation, not as a permanent second implementation. The JSON audit reproduces invalid text accepted by the legacy copy API, all ten new JSON fixtures failing at qualified type syntax, and absent C Map code generation. Porting the whole new API back would duplicate Rust work and prolong two divergent implementations.
* **Consequences**: C remains the current default until command/API compatibility, native execution, tooling, packaging and platform gates justify an explicit switch. The switch must document executable selection and intentional source differences, including JSON, while preserving bootstrap workflows and legacy ABI regressions. Retiring the legacy source API is not evidence that typed JSON codecs, remaining standard modules or full language semantics are implemented; those remain Rust completion requirements. No current executable is renamed or removed by this decision. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by this established format.

### 95 Prove Result handling on reachable paths before publication
* **Date**: 2026-09-06
* **Status**: Accepted for bounded source, collection, callable and direct/mutual recursive tree proofs
* **Decision**: I will track the identity and conditional existence of every produced Result layer through aliases, calls and containers. Every ordinary or propagated return must handle locally produced duties, return their complete value, or execute registered cleanup that handles them. A borrowing helper leaves responsibility with its caller.
* **Context**: Occurrence counting accepted collection-length queries, one-branch handling and partial searches as complete error handling. Typed provenance and bounded Boolean predicates distinguish possible aliases from guaranteed coverage. The reviewed proposal, failing path/collection/callable tests and corpus differential preceded production integration; the unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by this established format.
* **Consequences**: Explicit Result tag queries handle only the outer layer. Full traversals differ from partial projections and early exits; folds must retain or handle each old accumulator. Source summaries preserve borrowing, guaranteed handling, fresh output and actual aliases, including generic/callable effects. Exact recursive aliases and direct strict-list-suffix handlers require independent inductive body evidence. Unused inputs, explicit discard guards and closure restrictions remain. Generic templates, concrete definitions and editor/REPL publication share the bounded proof; codec inputs borrow and their outputs create fresh duties. One 400,000-work allowance, 32,768 predicate nodes and 128-depth/target/sequence limits fail closed. This is error accountability, not affine memory ownership or a termination proof. Direct recursive nominal handlers use engine-local strict-descendant certificates and whole-subtree duties; complete List/Map child traversals, exact callbacks and per-child defer preserve those certificates. Map cardinality tracks actual emptiness through deletion and views. Mutual handler groups use bounded iterative SCC discovery and simultaneous structural induction: every member verifies before outside publication, and every intra-group call retains strict descendant checks even after a peer has a ready summary. Active ancestor identity sets and typed List/Map representatives preserve distinct nominal layouts without certifying reconstruction or unboxed root aliases. Exact transparent wrapper edges preserve payload identity in typed child representatives, including nested wrappers; whole-wrapper cuts remain opaque. General recursive builders and richer recursive callable equations remain explicit completion targets. See [the handling contract](docs/RESULT_HANDLING.md).

### 94 Check formatting without modifying source files
* **Date**: 2026-09-06
* **Status**: Accepted for the Rust CLI
* **Decision**: I will add `fern-rs fmt --check source.fn`, accepting the flag before or after the source, with silent exit0 for canonical text and exit1 plus a source diagnostic for formatting drift. Check mode performs no writes or temporary-file creation.
* **Context**: CI needs to enforce the same formatting users apply locally without changing their checkout. Reusing the bounded syntax formatter preserves one canonical output instead of maintaining a separate style approximation.
* **Consequences**: Existing `fmt source.fn` still writes atomically and preserves permissions. Check mode preserves bytes, modification time, inode and symlink identity on success, drift and invalid input; it needs no backend/runtime. Other commands and duplicate flags reject `--check`. This is a Rust CLI addition; recursive discovery and C CLI parity remain separate. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by this established format.

### 91 Stage a verified Zed component with an immutable grammar revision
* **Date**: 2026-09-06
* **Status**: Accepted for local packaging and isolated actual-editor smoke tests
* **Decision**: I will register Fern's scalar grammar name and exact source revision, build the API0.7 extension as a Preview2 component with a separate pinned toolchain, and stage a reproducible package without modifying editor profiles. Discover only the Rust language server or use explicit literal configuration.
* **Context**: The prior installer removed user profile directories, the manifest lacked grammar registration, and the documented extension artifact was absent. A successful grammar test alone did not prove extension loading or LSP startup. Zed's own binary.path override also bypasses extension-supplied arguments.
* **Consequences**: Explicit overrides include `arguments = ["lsp"]`. Extension Rust1.97.1 and wasm32-wasip2 remain separate from compiler MSRV1.75. Locked offline builds require provisioned dependencies. Package validation checks the complete component, nested API marker, pinned grammar bytes, four staged queries and reproducible archives; the installer becomes a staging wrapper. Actual Zed1.18.0 smoke tests use owned temporary profiles for both discovery and override modes. The project uses its portable Tree-sitter/SDK29 grammar: the separately reproduced Zed source-builder profile loads in native Zed but carries a libc dependency unavailable to the web test runtime. The official extension CLI and marketplace publication are not claimed. The grammar pin must be published before remote dev installation can fetch it. The former `editor/zed-fern/README.md` guide was retired with the integration in Decision122. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by this established format.

The label/recovery follow-on pins grammar
`6d4efbb2f14a73be872f7c8e94c5ac31e54afcb9`. The stale revision fails exact staged
label-query validation; the matching revision passes reproducible packaging, the
85/33/30 corpus and both isolated actual-Zed startup modes with labeled source.
Remote publication remains outside this local verification.

### 93 Launch the native checker through a content-validated C bootstrap cache
* **Date**: 2026-09-06
* **Status**: Accepted for the default quality checker on macOS/Linux
* **Decision**: I will make the Fern-native checker the default after independent diagnostic/workflow and platform gates, using a Bash 3.2 entry, literal native build arguments and a private content-validated C-bootstrap cache. Python remains an explicit test oracle; ordinary style checks require neither Python nor Cargo.
* **Context**: The source checker reached exact diagnostics and 66 workflow cases, but a shell job PID could be reaped before cleanup and a stale cached executable could mask changed compiler/runtime inputs. The Bash spike required a small native supervisor retaining child identity. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by this established format; failing cache, supervisor, configuration and recipe tests preceded their implementations.
* **Consequences**: Immutable snapshots, exact source/tool/dependency contents and bounded lookup inventories govern reuse; permit one freshness retry, never stale fallback. Retained executable identities survive pruning without PID locks. Native supervision preserves normal exits and streams, with bootstrap failure125. Clang14+ uses a private empty explicit config and compiler-scoped default suppression; opaque config/plugin inputs reject. Full checks retain explicit Python integration oracles. Initial helper compilation, escaped process groups and concurrent filesystem freshness have the precise limits in [the launcher contract](docs/history/NATIVE_STYLE_CHECKER.md). macOS/Linux native matrices, sanitizers, config injection, concurrency and independent workflow gates validate the default switch. This does not switch the language's default compiler from C to Rust.

### 92 Pin decimal text classification to Unicode 16 with bounded work
* **Date**: 2026-09-06
* **Status**: Accepted for both native frontends and the REPL
* **Decision**: I will expose `String.is_decimal(String) -> Bool` and `str_is_decimal` as nonempty all-Nd classification using checksum-generated Unicode 16.0.0 tables. Native content above 16 MiB raises the existing String-size fault before classification; the Rust invocation path preserves deferred cleanup.
* **Context**: The pinned Python 3.14 bootstrap reference uses Unicode 16 decimal digits. ASCII-only matching and broader numeric predicates misclassify command arguments. Host Rust Unicode tables must not silently change Fern behavior.
* **Consequences**: A vendored primary UCD file and retained license generate 71 ranges covering 760 scalars offline. Empty and malformed native UTF-8 return false; NUL remains the native String terminator. Native scanning allocates nothing. REPL uses the same table, reserves one existing Machine step per 64 bytes before scanning, and retains its stricter storage and separate cleanup budgets. No numeric parsing, locale, normalization or new C defer guarantee is implied. [The classifier contract](docs/STRING_DECIMAL.md) records provenance, limits and exhaustive tests. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by this established format.

### 90 Preserve source label interfaces and written argument evaluation order
* **Date**: 2026-09-06
* **Status**: Accepted; direct source labels and mandatory enforcement implemented
* **Decision**: I will resolve direct source-call labels against original declaration interfaces, keeping external names distinct from pattern bindings and evaluating arguments once in written order. Reordered calls use typed local temporaries before parameter-order reads.
* **Context**: Decision7 requires readable calls, but reordering source expressions changes side effects and error propagation. Clause normalization, module aliases and generic specialization must not substitute synthetic names or call-site types for the source interface.
* **Consequences**: Positional arguments precede labeled arguments; duplicate, unknown, missing and multiply supplied positions are errors. Explicit external pattern names use `fn choose(enabled true: Bool)`. Structural function values, lambdas, runtime/compiler builtins and constructors retain positional interfaces and reject labels. Direct source calls require labels for exact Bool and repeated identical finalized declared scheme types; distinct generics/newtypes remain distinct. Classification follows whole-signature inference under a separate 400,000-unit work ceiling. Required pipe positions use labeled holes; inputs run first and once. Public metadata uses shared identifier/keyword rules and valid span ordering. Formatter/module/presentation metadata preserve source labels. Label-token definition/hover use current checked source interfaces and declared schemes; incomplete-member recovery retains label validation. Native/WASM grammar and highlights cover the bounded label corpus; incomplete-call name suggestions use parser-proven source positions and current lexical interfaces without claiming checked types or requiredness. Full syntax parity remains open. See [the label contract](docs/LABELED_CALLS.md). The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by this established format.

### 88 Complete file-text IO before publishing successful Results
* **Date**: 2026-09-06
* **Status**: Accepted for native and interactive text IO
* **Decision**: I will preserve File.read/write/append signatures and stable error codes while publishing only complete UTF-8, NUL-free text of at most 16 MiB. Native write success requires the complete fwrite, no stream error and successful fclose, including buffered flush.
* **Context**: Real failed writes could report Ok(4) while producing an empty file, and File.read could report success for bytes later truncated at NUL. Text APIs must not manufacture successful partial values. The three entry points are extracted into a focused runtime module for deterministic cleanup/failure tests.
* **Consequences**: Preflight rejects invalid/oversized write input before opening a target. Reads validate known length before allocation and probe one extra byte for growth. Every owned stream closes once, preserving an earlier error. IO after opening can still alter files; no atomicity, hard deadline, fsync or binary API is implied. REPL text policy matches while keeping its stricter budget; safe Rust File drop cannot observe late OS close errors, so only explicit unbuffered IO completion is claimed there. [The text IO contract](docs/FILE_TEXT_IO.md) documents compatibility changes and errors. Native invalid-byte String guards remain tested through direct injection. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by this established format.

### 89 Port quality workflows through bounded native process APIs
* **Date**: 2026-09-06
* **Status**: Accepted for the bootstrap workflow checkpoint; default migration remains open
* **Decision**: I will implement the Fern checker with immutable returned state, literal `System.exec_args_bounded` commands, separate diagnostic stderr, and source-level handling of process failures. Compare exact style diagnostics and semantic command workflows against Python before changing the default.
* **Context**: Style-only parity did not cover build/test/example continuation, Git checks, command arguments or CLI failures. The shared process and stderr APIs now provide the required native contracts without a shell or lossy text capture.
* **Consequences**: Every command has a 300-second deadline and independent 8 MiB stream limits. Ordinary tool output and argument order remain tested; OS-specific exception wording and terminal decoration are not byte-identical contracts. CLI write failures preserve exit 2. Workflow oracles pin Python 3.14 because argparse short-help clustering changed since Python 3.11; native CLI behavior is fixed across hosts. [The checker contract](docs/history/BOOTSTRAP_CHECKER.md) records 47 workflow scenarios and the remaining Unicode numeric-path classification gap. Python remains the reference and shipping default until remaining parity and launch gates pass. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by this established format.

The Decision92 follow-on closes the argument-classification gap: only the first
scalar after `-` or `-.` is classified, matching Python 3.14 prefix semantics.
Nineteen additional reference-first scenarios bring workflow coverage to 66 cases
under both frontends. Native default launch and cache correctness remain separate.

### 87 Report stderr failures without changing global signal policy
* **Date**: 2026-09-06
* **Status**: Accepted for native developer tooling
* **Decision**: I will expose `System.write_stderr(String) -> Result(Unit, Int)` as exact UTF-8 output without an inserted newline. Validate at most 16 MiB before writing; return stable errors for invalid text, size and IO. An output failure does not implicitly replace the caller's primary exit status.
* **Context**: The Fern checker must emit argument errors on stderr, and a closed pipe must produce a handled error instead of terminating the process. Reopening descriptors, toggling shared flags or changing process-global SIGPIPE handlers would interfere with embedding callers.
* **Consequences**: Writes use 16 KiB chunks and at most 65,536 attempts, including EINTR. Only the calling thread masks SIGPIPE; its prior mask and preexisting pending signal are preserved. After EPIPE, only a newly pending signal is consumed before restoration. Embedding excludes competing consumers, disposition changes and simultaneous SIGPIPE injection into that thread. Partial output can precede an error, and blocking kernel writes have no hard deadline. Empty text succeeds without descriptor access. Native heap Result needs no Rust adapter; C also canonicalizes Unit annotations. REPL native effects remain explicitly unavailable. [The API contract](docs/PROCESS_EXECUTION.md#standard-error-output) records these limits. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by this established format.

### 86 Preserve signed 64-bit Int through the C frontend ABI
* **Date**: 2026-09-06
* **Status**: Accepted for the shared runtime migration
* **Decision**: I will lower checked C-frontend Int values as QBE `l` through literals, parameters, returns, locals, arithmetic, comparison operands, heap Result payloads, tuples, lists and ranges. Bool/Unit retain `w`, Float retains `d`, and actual native C `int` results receive sign extension when exposed as Fern Int.
* **Context**: Passing a timeout such as 4294967297 through a 32-bit intermediate silently converts an invalid limit into a valid one. Changing only the final runtime call cannot repair values already narrowed in helpers or local arithmetic. Raw function pointers also need their own callable identity rather than managed-pointer cleanup.
* **Consequences**: Decimal accumulation checks signed bounds; unary MIN is accepted. Add/subtract/multiply/negation wrap, MIN/-1 division yields MIN and remainder zero, and inclusive MAX ranges stop before incrementing. Typed direct/indirect calls and nested Result tuple bindings preserve their native widths. C's legacy packed Option still has a 32-bit payload; power/bitwise and controlled zero-divisor cleanup gaps remain open. This is scoped compatibility work, not full C/Rust parity. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by this established format.

### 85 Capture bounded literal processes with explicit cleanup ownership
* **Date**: 2026-09-06
* **Status**: Accepted for native execution and bootstrap workflows
* **Decision**: I will expose `System.exec_args_bounded(List(String), Int, Int) -> Result((Int, String, String), Int)` through a shared heap Result ABI. Normal exit statuses, including 127, remain successful captures; configuration, spawn, deadline, size, IO, text and signal failures have separate stable Int codes.
* **Context**: Developer tooling needs literal argv, independent stdout/stderr and explicit resource limits. C and Rust tuple representations differ, so Rust adapts only the successful native tuple after checking the Result tag. Full-width source arguments are required by decision 86.
* **Consequences**: [The execution contract](docs/PROCESS_EXECUTION.md) specifies argument/PATH/text limits, 1–600,000 ms deadlines, independent 0–16 MiB streams, stdin EOF and preserved caller descriptors/signals. Explicit bounded PATH search uses `posix_spawn`, because macOS `posix_spawnp` can run a shell on ENOEXEC. Every child owns a private process group and retains its unreaped identity until cleanup; escaped descendants are not contained, and OS cleanup can extend wall-clock time. Only confirmed exited-child-only Darwin groups allow the documented conservative EPERM exception. Embedding excludes competing reapers and concurrent signal/environment policy mutation. Debug/release/sanitizer and source-native tests cover failure paths and resource boundaries. Legacy process APIs remain compatibility surfaces. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by this established format.

### 84 Generate the indentation-aware editor grammar from authored templates
* **Date**: 2026-09-06
* **Status**: Accepted; bounded native/query/WASM corpus verified
* **Decision**: I will keep explicit grammar/query templates as editable sources, render every published grammar/query deterministically, and generate parser sources and ABI14 WASM only with pinned Tree-sitter 0.26.12 and WASI SDK 29.0. The Rust compiler and accepted source corpus remain the language authority.
* **Context**: The old generator silently skipped the actual indentation grammar and could not derive aliases, newtypes or function clauses from C token names. Stale WASM copies and uncompiled query text did not establish editor correctness.
* **Consequences**: The gate checks 24 accepted sources against Rust and native/WASM trees, eight bounded recovery cases, eight incremental edits, four executable queries, and scanner malformed-state/column/stack limits under sanitizers. The external scanner's explicit lifecycle exception permits Tree-sitter `ts_calloc`/`ts_free` and defensive reset/return guards instead of assertions on untrusted serialized state. All 128 indentation levels fit the 514-byte serialized state; columns are 32-bit and capped at 1 MiB. Generation checks every parser source/header plus both identical WASM copies; build output uses the canonical basename because it affects WASM metadata. Full Rust syntax parity and Zed extension registration/packaging remain open. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by this established decision format.

The union follow-on extends this verified profile to 38 accepted sources, 12 recovery cases and 13 incremental edits. Structural assertions distinguish functions returning unions from function-valued union members, and typed binders from wildcards. Module-alias fixtures use real Rust module graphs; native/WASM trees and highlight captures agree. Both generated WASM artifacts are 110,316 bytes with SHA256 `fccdfd05b2db4117680058e3d6fe2c39bd8d13c02ed24d95486cb79b218d1f0a`. Broader syntax and extension packaging remain open.

The control/collection follow-through verifies 69 accepted sources, 20 malformed
inputs and 22 incremental edits with fresh per-run native caches. A serialized
post-dedent separator and exact 1 MiB indentation boundary prevent cross-line
calls and unbounded scanner work. Three named malformed inline for/with headers
still absorb the following declaration; their exact error ranges remain tracked,
without a full-recovery claim.

The label follow-on verifies 80 accepted sources, 27 malformed inputs (24 recover
and three retain their named gaps), and 27 incremental edits. External pattern/call
labels have separate parameter captures; strict Rust checks all accepted and edited
sources. Both WASM copies are 243,311 bytes, SHA256
`69c118755c23ee56708e838fb6c1956a8214fb2d0b0c5760a715d92b1a46f88c`.
The matching Zed grammar revision must be repinned after this grammar is committed.

The recovery follow-on closes all three original inline-header gaps while preserving
their source bytes. Hidden prefix reductions and contextual declaration/lambda `fn`
tokens retain real missing-token/error nodes and all following declarations. The
full native/WASM profile now verifies 85 valid, 33 malformed and 30 incremental
cases, with scanner keyword boundaries and lookahead under the existing limits.
Both WASM copies are 277,598 bytes, SHA256
`27f01d3d422bad335369b4069fc86c7239b097180ba5f5dc710ed5aab3d12fef`.

The numeric editor follow-on verifies 93 accepted sources, all 33 existing
malformed recovery ranges and 33 incremental edits. Binary/octal/hexadecimal
prefixes, valid integer separators and exponent-only Floats retain exact numeric
token kinds/text. All published parser/WASM files are generated from the authored
template; remaining syntax and numeric semantic validation still belong to the
compiler. This extends Decision84 without changing Fern numeric semantics.


### 83 Directional finite unions and typed narrowing
* **Date**: 2026-09-06
* **Status**: Accepted for the bounded first checkpoint
* **Decision**: I will implement canonical finite ordinary-type unions with directional member/subset conversions, typed binding/wildcard narrowing and full-width tagged GC envelopes. Exact unification remains symmetric; existing containers and function types remain invariant. Generic substitutions normalize before specialization and do not guess ambiguous membership.
* **Context**: The union examples in DESIGN.md specify arguments and typed narrowing without defining principal union inference, constructor refinements, variance or lifted capabilities.
* **Consequences**: Declared union contexts permit mixed branches and fresh literals; inferred heterogeneous joins remain errors. Narrow before operators, printing or Map-key use. Result-bearing alternatives retain handling and capture obligations. Normalization, assignment and coverage are bounded, including inactive public IR metadata. Constructor refinements, variance, implicit joins and lifted capabilities remain successors. See [the union contract](docs/UNIONS.md) for representation, limits and executable examples. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by this established decision format.

### 82 Separate module type and value namespaces
* **Date**: 2026-09-06
* **Status**: Accepted for Rust migration completion
* **Decision**: I will keep type and value namespaces independent through declarations, visibility, imports, reexports and source navigation. Each declaration retains its own public provenance; spelling-only export metadata does not authorize visibility.
* **Context**: An alias or nominal owner may share a name with a function or unrelated constructor. A combined symbol table either rejects these valid declarations or exports a private sibling accidentally. Constructors belong to the value namespace and inherit visibility only from their nominal owner; aliases introduce no constructors.
* **Consequences**: Annotations resolve visible types; calls, pipes, function values and patterns resolve visible values after checking lexical receivers. Same-namespace collisions remain errors. Selected imports may bring both public identities into scope; editor definition returns exact type-then-value locations, deduplicating identical record anchors. Parser-confirmed import delimiters determine selector roles. Formatting and documentation preserve independent visibility and declaration ownership. Combined editor symbol accounting retains the 100,000-entry/8 MiB metadata caps and existing bounded graph/snapshot profiles. No runtime or executable IR representation changes are required. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by the established decision format.

### 81 Run source-owned unit tests alongside documentation examples
* **Date**: 2026-09-06
* **Status**: Accepted for Rust migration completion
* **Decision**: I will discover zero-argument `test_` functions from parsed source and execute each checked Unit or Result(Unit,E) function independently. Normal `fern test` includes both unit tests and documentation examples; `--doc` restricts execution to documentation.
* **Context**: The design specifies ordinary named test functions, but the current command only executes documentation examples. Selecting by original source identity avoids rerunning imports or replacing user main references. Boolean/integer return values must not silently pass as unasserted tests.
* **Consequences**: Real private helpers and original main remain callable. Native tests use the existing bounded capture and cleanup mechanism, continue after failures (including invalid test signatures), and report original names and locations. Discovery retains parameterized groups so eligibility errors are reported independently for each test. Combined discovery is limited to 256 tests; unsupported result signatures reject before native compilation. Unit and documentation execution use a dedicated QBE test mode: invoking the resolved process-exit API always diagnoses and exits unsuccessfully, including through helpers and callbacks, so exit0 cannot bypass remaining assertions. Ordinary application emission and unused exit functions remain unchanged; exit-behavior tests must use a child process. Eligibility uses one ordinary checker pass and the selected reusable source signature, with no editor metadata budget. Assertion libraries, benchmarks, coverage and watch remain tracked separately. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by the established decision format.

### 79 Preserve distinct newtype identities without wrapper allocation
* **Date**: 2026-09-06
* **Status**: Accepted for Rust migration completion
* **Decision**: I will represent newtypes as semantic nominal identities with validated unboxed payload layouts. Explicit construction and projection lower to the same native operand, while parameter, result, container and closure boundaries use the payload's full-width ABI.
* **Context**: DESIGN promises distinct UserId/ProductId identities with zero runtime cost. A tagged one-field record would introduce allocation and change Float/native ABI behavior. Concrete layout keys distinguish valid nested wrappers from impossible unboxed cycles, while existing heap indirection supports guarded recursion.
* **Consequences**: Same-identity scalar equality and List.contains inherit Int/Float/Bool/String behavior; Map keys inherit Int/Bool/String behavior with String content comparison. Arithmetic, ordering, Print/interpolation and implicit conversion remain unavailable without explicit projection or future traits. Wrapped Result values retain handling obligations. Checked Wrap/Unwrap and newtype patterns are validated at public IR boundaries; depth/type/program-work limits apply before expansion. REPL values reuse underlying storage, while formatter/docs/editor preserve source identities. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by the established decision format.

### 80 Publish checked inferred documentation without executing examples
* **Date**: 2026-09-06
* **Status**: Accepted for Rust migration completion
* **Decision**: I will add explicit `doc --inferred` generation using one complete library check and bounded reusable source schemes per module graph. Original headers and documentation remain, supplemented by resolved signatures and intrinsic requirements.
* **Context**: Source-only documentation cannot explain omitted private types. Rechecking the program per declaration scales poorly and risks inconsistent generic identities; backend specializations erase source patterns and do not describe reusable functions. A checked library pipeline now validates all bodies without inventing main.
* **Consequences**: Default documentation remains parser-only. Checked mode resolves current imports, preserves exact source anchors, rejects invalid graphs and enforces aggregate graph/metadata/output budgets. Source contents are borrowed from bounded project caches, with actual loaded and cached copies charged once. Every documented source and loaded dependency is protected against output replacement, including hardlinks. Generated names never appear as user types, and directory search/escaping remain shared. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by the established decision format.

### 78 Complete one incomplete member using independent current-source evidence
* **Date**: 2026-09-06
* **Status**: Accepted for Rust migration completion
* **Decision**: I will recover a single member selector for completion only when its receiver is already concrete and the enclosing function group has an independently fixed concrete signature. Recovery is an explicit partial proof with non-executable IR, never repaired source or a guessed member.
* **Context**: Ordinary checked source facts cannot cover the moment a user types `value.`. Feeding missing-operation constraints into whole-signature inference could fabricate receiver types, while candidate replacement can hide independent errors. The parser can preserve source offsets using one private token and an opaque site.
* **Consequences**: The ordinary graph, signatures, unaffected bodies and local constraints still validate. Only local hole-dependent unknowns may remain private editor markers; they never justify receiver evidence or enter schemes/QBE/REPL. Current overlays and exact UTF-16 edits are preserved, all existing limits apply, and unrelated errors retain lexical fallback. Editor library checking uses the real source graph without inserting main. See [the recovery contract](docs/history/EDITOR_RECOVERY.md). The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by the established decision format.

### 77 Evaluate immutable JSON in the REPL with explicit aggregate limits
* **Date**: 2026-09-06
* **Status**: Accepted for Rust migration completion
* **Decision**: I will implement the dynamic JSON API in the safe, std-only Rust evaluator using immutable shared nodes and the same native format/error/resource profile. No native FFI, subprocess evaluation or lossy serialization intermediary is used.
* **Context**: Native opaque JSON values now have a tested contract. Interactive programs must retain exact number text, Unicode including escaped NUL, insertion order, ordinary Result errors and immutable shared children across session entries. A per-call parser cap alone cannot bound repeated large operations in one entry.
* **Consequences**: Decimal-to-Float conversion uses Rust 1.75's nearest/ties-even parser after strict JSON validation, and Float construction reproduces the native 17-significant-digit spelling. Logical native allocation/work charges preserve per-operation limits; normal interactive evaluation additionally has separate 64 MiB aggregate allocation and work ceilings, with independent 8 MiB cleanup reserves. Charges occur before work/allocation, including failed attempts; aggregate allocation charges include larger semantic Rust node/collection representations while native logical per-operation counters stay unchanged. Retained storage uses an iterative unique-node walk under the existing 16 MiB/200,000 session ceilings; cached expanded sizes bound serialization but never replace physical sharing accounting. JSON domain errors remain ordinary Results; aggregate faults retain existing first-failure, cleanup and atomic binding behavior. C source migration and typed codecs remain separate. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by the established decision format.


### 76 Execute documentation examples as checked native tests
* **Date**: 2026-09-06
* **Status**: Accepted for Rust migration completion
* **Decision**: I will implement explicit `fern-rs test --doc` execution of fenced Fern examples from parser-owned documentation. Trailing `# =>` expectations are checked Fern patterns, including Result/Option wildcards, and failures produce a nonzero test result.
* **Context**: The existing Python documentation check compiles snippets but strips their expected results and never executes them. DESIGN requires runnable examples, multiline setup and constructor-pattern expectations. Reusing the parser, checker and native backend preserves ordinary Fern semantics and gives examples access to private declarations in their owning module.
* **Consequences**: Each example receives isolated local bindings and a checked synthetic test function, while module imports resolve through an in-memory overlay. Library checking validates all bodies without inventing main; ordinary executable checking still requires an entry. Original entry points are preserved by function ID, and validated IR entry selection runs only the test harness. Expectations attach only to complete top-level expression statements, with lexical comment ranges distinguishing markers from string text. Discovery, example count/source bytes, runtime duration and captured output are bounded; current source is never overwritten. General unit-test syntax, coverage and watch mode remain separate CLI milestones. Tests explicitly execute user code; documentation generation itself never executes examples. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by the established decision format.


### 75 Expose typed Rust JSON values through explicit native adapters
* **Date**: 2026-09-05
* **Status**: Accepted for Rust migration completion
* **Decision**: I will migrate the Rust frontend to opaque json.Value/json.Error types, immutable builders and lossless ordered collection access using explicit full-width native ABI adapters. The Json compatibility spelling resolves to the same identities.
* **Context**: The native JSON parser is verified, but the existing source API still copies Strings. Native JSON member records and Fern tagged tuples have different layouts, and Float arguments require a floating-point ABI rather than an integer bit argument. The C frontend has separate qualified-type and container limitations that must not be hidden by changing registry declarations alone.
* **Consequences**: Rust parse returns Result(Value, Error) and stringify accepts Value. Explicit conversions preserve exact numbers, Unicode and NUL errors. Members return JSON String keys as Values, and object builders convert a once-evaluated Map into checked parallel native lists. Adapter allocations and expanded shared subtrees are bounded before publication, including depth/node/output growth. Opaque values cannot be fabricated, inspected as records or implicitly compared/printed. The C source contract and old native symbols remain explicitly legacy until their own migration; Rust REPL evaluation stays explicitly unavailable for these operations until the following parity checkpoint. Ten native output cases and twelve semantic rejections define this vertical migration. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by the established decision format.


### 72 Preserve resolved global references as explicit AST identities
* **Date**: 2026-09-05
* **Status**: Accepted for Rust migration completion
* **Decision**: I will distinguish resolved global names, calls and pipe targets from lexical names in the module-resolved AST. Resolution checks the original source root against lexical bindings before producing explicit global forms.
* **Context**: Rewriting an import alias to a canonical module string can accidentally capture a different local with that canonical spelling. This affects compilation, dependency ordering and checked editor facts: `import model as m` followed by `let model = 3` must not turn `m.value()` into a field access on that local. Giving all dotted names global priority would instead break actual lexical shadowing.
* **Consequences**: Function values, direct calls, pipes, captures and generic dependency discovery retain their resolved identity. Source parsing and formatting preserve written syntax; module resolution owns the transition to explicit global forms. Every AST visitor handles these forms explicitly, and regression tests cover aliases, canonical-name collisions and real source-root shadowing. No magic string prefixes or span-only identity side tables are used. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by the established decision format.


### 74 Expand transparent aliases before nominal checking with shared budgets
* **Date**: 2026-09-05
* **Status**: Accepted for Rust migration completion
* **Decision**: I will implement scalar and generic transparent type aliases as source declarations, expanding their references before nominal registry construction without adding an executable representation. Alias expansion charges the same bounded work budget used by dependency analysis and inference.
* **Context**: DESIGN distinguishes transparent aliases from distinct zero-cost newtypes and set-theoretic unions. Reusing tagged one-field records for all three would change their promised identity or runtime cost. Aliases can provide useful source vocabulary while retaining existing type equality and runtime layout.
* **Consequences**: Original alias declarations and module identities remain available to formatting, documentation and editor navigation. Expansion substitutes generics without capture, rejects arity/name/cycle errors, and checks depth/node/output budgets before allocating expanded trees. Nominal recursive records remain valid; transparent cyclic aliases do not. Aliases add no constructors and do not create a privacy boundary, while existing constructor visibility stays enforced. Newtype representation and union coercion/narrowing remain separate checkpoints. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by the established decision format.

### 68 Publish checked source facts for editor hover
* **Date**: 2026-09-05
* **Status**: Accepted for the authorized T2a Rust tooling milestone
* **Decision**: I will expose bounded source-facing type facts from finalized function validation, retaining original declaration and binding origins. Editor hover and valid-source member details will use these facts only after the complete ordinary checker succeeds on the current module overlay graph.
* **Context**: Source navigation already tracks scopes, aliases and exact UTF-16 locations. Final backend IR contains specialized copies and generated dispatch/closure names, while inference probes contain provisional variables; neither can safely define user-facing generic hover identities. Shared source presentation now validates types and patterns and explicitly renames inferred quantified identities without conflating them with declared variables.
* **Consequences**: Generic declaration schemes and instantiated occurrence types remain distinct; intrinsic requirements are reported in checker-owned language. Clauses and captured/shadowed locals preserve source anchors. Metadata allocation and output are bounded and optional, and ordinary compilation retains its existing API and behavior. Invalid current source yields no stale type facts. T2a covers hover and typed details on valid source; the separate T2b recovery milestone will handle incomplete receiver/member syntax. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by the established decision format.

### 73 Generate bounded directory documentation as one searchable artifact
* **Date**: 2026-09-05
* **Status**: Accepted for Rust migration completion
* **Decision**: I will extend parser-based documentation to source directories with deterministic file ordering, module navigation and local text search in a single standalone HTML artifact. Markdown remains available and single-file behavior stays compatible.
* **Context**: Individual source documentation is implemented, but a library's users need to move between modules and find declarations. A single artifact avoids partial multi-file publication and filename collisions, and local filtering needs no network service or external dependencies.
* **Consequences**: Recursive discovery has explicit depth, entry, source-byte and file-count limits; symbolic links are not followed. Every source parses before output is installed, and output cannot replace any input inode. Source paths and documentation remain escaped data; the fixed search script only reads text and toggles visibility. Default directories exclude hidden entries and build/dependency directories, with the exclusions documented. Executable doc tests and inferred documentation signatures remain separately gated features. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by the established decision format.

### 70 Replace the JSON string-copy baseline with opaque JSON values
* **Date**: 2026-09-05
* **Status**: Accepted for staged Rust migration completion
* **Decision**: I will implement immutable opaque json.Value and json.Error types with a validating parser, explicit conversions and bounded serialization. New native symbols preserve the old String-copy ABI until each frontend's source API is migrated and verified.
* **Context**: Existing json.parse and json.stringify copy strings without validating JSON. A dynamic value model must preserve exact number text and valid JSON strings containing escaped NUL, even though Fern String cannot currently represent NUL. Typed derive/decode codecs need this foundation first.
* **Consequences**: The public migration will use Result(json.Value, json.Error) and Result(String, json.Error); String-as-Value calls become type errors. JSON numbers retain their lexemes, objects preserve insertion order and reject duplicate decoded keys, invalid Unicode/unpaired surrogates fail, and one leading UTF-8 BOM is accepted. Parsing is bounded to 1 MiB input, depth 128, 100,000 values and 32 MiB logical allocation; encoding is bounded to 16 MiB with charged traversal. JSON-to-Fern String conversion rejects embedded NUL without truncation. Native runtime, frontend/ABI and REPL/builders land as separate verified checkpoints; lowercase json remains canonical and existing Json compatibility spelling is preserved when migrated. The format profile follows RFC 8259 with explicit stricter duplicate/Unicode choices. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by the established decision format.

### 71 Represent delayed inference shapes with non-executable probe nodes
* **Date**: 2026-09-05
* **Status**: Accepted for Rust migration completion
* **Decision**: I will retain delayed field, update, tuple-rest and iteration constraints in a bounded obligation table, using an explicitly tagged probe-only IR node to continue gathering later body evidence. Construction is crate-private and requires a private token; the node is never executable Fern IR.
* **Context**: Retrying a body after its first unresolved projection cannot discover an annotation or call later in that same body. Returning a fake Unit, local or field-index value would obscure this gap and could corrupt later compiler passes. A second complete type checker would duplicate the existing typing rules.
* **Consequences**: Probe nodes retain evaluated child expressions and their result type slot; delayed obligations resolve only from independent type evidence, without guessing nominal types or tuple arity. Union/assignment revisions determine progress, and retries share the whole-signature work budget. Probes are discarded before generalized source is rechecked. Finalization, public IR validation, code generation, interactive execution and editor fact publication must reject any surviving probe. All affected visitors are updated explicitly and rejection/resource/branch-order tests guard the boundary. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by the established decision format.

### 67 Generalize private signatures by recursive component
* **Date**: 2026-09-05
* **Status**: Accepted for Rust migration completion
* **Decision**: I will infer omitted private parameter and return types from patterns and function bodies in callee-first recursive components, then publish closed schemes with intrinsic capability requirements. Calls to completed schemes instantiate fresh variables; unfinished inferred recursive members share monotypes.
* **Context**: Pattern-only inference requires annotations for ordinary identity and higher-order helpers. Using whichever caller is visited first would make types order-dependent. Explicit generic annotations remain universal and must not be weakened to make inference succeed; existing complete-parameter return inference already handles annotated mutual recursion with distinct generic names.
* **Consequences**: Public boundaries remain annotated and omitted main remains Unit. Explicit type variables stay rigid, local bindings stay monomorphic, and inferred polymorphic recursion requires a complete annotation. Generalization preserves parameter/result relationships and rejects unanchored recursive results or ambiguous requirements. Source-provided Infer remains forbidden. Dependency traversal, constraints, recursive solving and scheme closure share bounded work. Core generalization lands before explicit delayed shape obligations; the milestone stays open until later body evidence can resolve fields, updates, iteration and tuple-rest shapes without guessed types or fake values. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by the established decision format.

### 69 Generate source documentation with the Rust parser
* **Date**: 2026-09-05
* **Status**: Accepted for Rust migration completion
* **Decision**: I will generate Rust frontend documentation from parsed source declarations and literal @doc metadata, grouping function clauses and retaining their original source signatures. Documentation generation does not require an executable main or run examples implicitly.
* **Context**: The current Python generator recognizes signatures with a regular expression, which cannot cover nested function types, clause patterns or Unicode identifiers reliably. The Rust parser already establishes declaration boundaries and documentation ownership.
* **Consequences**: The first checkpoint accepts one source file, writes Markdown by default or standalone escaped HTML, and supports atomic output files without overwriting source aliases. Parsing and output are bounded. All declarations are included and public visibility is shown; inferred signatures are not invented from omitted annotations. Directory navigation/search and explicit executable doc tests follow as separate checkpoints. Documentation text is literal data in HTML; no scripts or remote assets are required. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by the established decision format.

### 66 Validate generic bodies with rigid equality and capability requirements
* **Date**: 2026-09-05
* **Status**: Accepted for Rust migration completion
* **Decision**: I will validate every generic body before specialization using rigid declared type variables and explicit internal requirements for overloaded operations. Type equality will no longer accept an arbitrary concrete type merely because one side is generic.
* **Context**: The current template probe can accept an unused `fn bad(x: a) -> a: 1`, while concrete specialization rejects some later uses. Existing generic arithmetic and scalar interpolation are useful and must retain their actual numeric/display restrictions rather than be checked with an arbitrary Int instance.
* **Consequences**: Capability requirements preserve the concrete domains of arithmetic, addition, ordering, equality, printing, collection membership and map keys. Calls and function values instantiate and propagate those requirements with their types, under bounded work. Concrete impossible requirements and incompatible universal returns are errors even when unused. Conditional Result discard obligations remain distinct from type equality. Concrete specialization continues to validate the backend boundary. Public where/trait syntax and whole private-signature generalization build on this internal scheme representation separately. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by the established decision format.


### 65 Index editor symbols by source identity and lexical scope
* **Date**: 2026-09-05
* **Status**: Accepted for Rust migration completion
* **Decision**: I will build bounded editor symbol snapshots from the current source graph and lexical bindings, with definitions identified by their original file and source anchor. Navigation and completion will use the same module visibility and qualification facts as compilation.
* **Context**: Final IR identifiers are local to functions and may be duplicated by generic specialization or closure lifting. Text matching cannot distinguish shadowed bindings, separate clause parameters or imported private names. Existing unsaved overlays and UTF-16 synchronization already define coherent editor inputs.
* **Consequences**: Accepted edits invalidate semantic snapshots. Unresolved or invalid current source produces no stale semantic locations. Completion is deterministic, bounded and respects scopes, aliases and public exports; builtin prefix completion may remain available on incomplete source without inventing types. Exact source ranges distinguish code from comments and literal text. Semantic hover and typed members require checker facts and will be advertised only when implemented. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by the established decision format.

### 64 Infer private parameter types from complete pattern evidence
* **Date**: 2026-09-05
* **Status**: Accepted for Rust migration completion
* **Decision**: I will collect constraints from every clause pattern and supplied parameter annotation before normalizing a private function group. This stage fills omitted annotations only when their types are fully determined, including explicitly anchored generic variables.
* **Context**: Literal and constructor patterns often establish a function's input type without any caller. Using the first caller as evidence would make otherwise generic functions depend on call order. Full private signature generalization needs a separate recursive-component solver.
* **Consequences**: All clauses constrain one slot per parameter position. Public parameter annotations remain mandatory. Empty lists, generic nullary constructors, catchalls and tuple-rest shapes alone may remain ambiguous and require annotations until whole-signature inference lands. Constructor schemas use fresh variables, explicit generic names remain rigid, conflicts report source diagnostics, and pattern/type work has one bounded budget across the pass. Existing coverage and Result checks still run after normalization. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by the established decision format.


### 62 Eliminate eligible self-tail calls without changing cleanup semantics
* **Date**: 2026-09-05
* **Status**: Accepted for Rust migration completion
* **Decision**: I will lower direct self calls in return position to parameter updates and a function-local backedge when that function has no owned defer registration. Compiler scratch stack slots will be declared in the entry block, with initialization retained at each logical use.
* **Context**: Fern uses recursion instead of while/loop. Ordinary native calls grow the stack, and QBE alloc8 outside the entry block can allocate dynamically on repeated paths. Deferred cleanup must still execute once per actual function activation.
* **Consequences**: Argument expressions evaluate left-to-right into temporary values before any parameter slot changes. Faults and early exits skip later arguments. Full-width values and the existing environment/fault context are preserved. Functions owning defer, mutual recursion and indirect calls keep ordinary calls; nested lifted closure bodies do not disable an otherwise eligible parent. This is direct self-tail-call elimination, not a general proper-tail-call guarantee. Hoisted scratch storage prevents loop and with temporaries from growing the stack on each backedge. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by the established decision format.

### 63 Normalize adjacent function clauses through the shared pattern engine
* **Date**: 2026-09-05
* **Status**: Accepted for Rust migration completion
* **Decision**: I will retain adjacent clauses in source syntax and normalize each group to one checked function before return inference. Typed pattern parameters, guards and arrow bodies use the existing exhaustive match semantics.
* **Context**: DESIGN specifies function clauses and pattern parameters, while the Rust frontend already has shared pattern coverage, function-owned control flow and cleanup. A separate dispatch implementation would risk different coverage and Result handling rules.
* **Consequences**: Clauses must agree on arity, parameter types, visibility and supplied return annotations; initially generic names must remain consistent across a group. Guards do not guarantee coverage, and missing cases are errors rather than DESIGN's earlier warning. Whole-function documentation appears before the first clause. Synthetic argument names cannot collide with source identifiers; balanced dispatch tuples preserve the 255-parameter limit. Whole-pattern Result discard checks precede hidden argument reads, and each arm retains its own binder obligations. This checkpoint requires annotated parameter patterns; pattern-anchored inference and complete private signature generalization follow separately. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by the established decision format.

### 61 Preserve indentation for block expressions inside delimiters
* **Date**: 2026-09-05
* **Status**: Accepted for Rust migration completion
* **Decision**: I will preserve bounded indentation frames for multiline expression suites inside calls, lists and tuples, including inline separating commas and closing delimiters.
* **Context**: Suppressing all layout within parentheses prevented valid composition such as `println(match value: ...)`. Block callbacks already needed a limited version of the same mechanism. Users should not need a temporary variable merely to pass an expression to a function.
* **Consequences**: Match, if, for, with and callback suites restore significant layout at their owning delimiter depth. Ordinary nested delimiters still suspend layout. Frames close only their owned indentation before separators/closers; malformed or excessive nesting reports a source diagnostic. Comment and multiline-string contents do not become layout instructions. Formatting must retain equivalent checked IR and remain idempotent. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by the established decision format.

### 60 Share bounded sequence patterns across language constructs
* **Date**: 2026-09-05
* **Status**: Accepted for Rust migration completion
* **Decision**: I will support exact list patterns and list/tuple suffix patterns ending in `..name` or `.._` through the common checked pattern engine. Potentially failing destructuring requires match or let-else; ordinary let, for and with success bindings retain their existing irrefutability requirement.
* **Context**: DESIGN specifies list and tuple rest patterns, including function clauses, but its plain-list destructuring examples do not explain length mismatch. Silently reading beyond a list or introducing an unchecked failure would violate the existing binding contract.
* **Consequences**: List lengths and nested tags are checked before projections. Named tails are materialized only after the whole structural pattern succeeds and before any guard that uses them; ignored tails allocate nothing. List tails initially copy a bounded suffix and preserve immutable aliases. Tuple tails retain tuple identity, including singleton tuples, while an empty suffix is Unit. Match coverage models empty/nonempty lists and remains bounded under sequence expansion. Rest must appear last and can only bind or discard; Result-bearing values cannot be silently discarded by prefix or suffix patterns. Refutable plain-list examples require an else branch or match until a stronger static length proof exists. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by the established decision format.

### 59 Infer private return schemes before concrete specialization
* **Date**: 2026-09-05
* **Status**: Accepted for Rust migration completion
* **Decision**: I will infer omitted private function returns with shared, bounded type constraints before the existing concrete specialization pass. Public return signatures remain explicit and omitted main remains Unit.
* **Context**: DESIGN permits internal inference while requiring annotated APIs. Checking definitions independently loses forward and recursive return constraints; specializing a generic probe as Int would reject valid Float uses or silently change a scheme.
* **Consequences**: Annotated parameters remain the boundary for this checkpoint. Return evidence from tails, early returns and propagation can establish concrete types or declared generic schemes. Only unresolved shape dependencies are retried; genuine errors remain errors. Unanchored cycles require an annotation. A shared work and inference-storage budget bounds retries across all definitions. Public provenance survives module flattening. This does not claim full parameter inference, function clauses, or complete unused generic-body checking. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by the established decision format.

### 58 Preserve UTF-8 strings at slicing and splitting boundaries
* **Date**: 2026-09-05
* **Status**: Accepted for Rust migration completion
* **Decision**: I will retain byte-indexed String.slice and its existing index clamping, while requiring clamped endpoints to be Unicode scalar boundaries. Splitting on an empty delimiter produces one complete Unicode scalar per String.
* **Context**: Native byte-by-byte splitting can produce invalid UTF-8, while interactive strings already reject invalid slices. DESIGN defines byte lengths without specifying these non-ASCII corner cases. A String must remain valid UTF-8 across these operations.
* **Consequences**: Clamping first sets start to at least zero and end to at least start, then bounds both by byte length. Interior-byte endpoints are errors even when the requested slice is empty. Rust guards execute deferred cleanup before reporting `String.slice indices must be UTF-8 character boundaries`; the shared legacy C function rejects the same request independently. Empty input split on an empty delimiter yields an empty list; combining marks remain separate scalars, with no implicit grapheme segmentation or normalization. Nonempty delimiter behavior is preserved. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by the established decision format.

### 57 Define entry errors and guard legacy runtime preconditions
* **Date**: 2026-09-05
* **Status**: Accepted for Rust migration completion
* **Decision**: I will accept `main -> Result((), E)` for every concrete error type, exit zero for Ok and one for Err after deferred cleanup, and report `fern: main returned Err` for an unhandled entry error. Runtime faults take precedence. Existing direct-valued list access keeps its source signature and reports invalid access through the explicit Rust fault context.
* **Context**: DESIGN specifies Result entry points but does not define a universal Error type or an error-display protocol. The existing List.get/head signatures have incompatible direct-value and recoverable descriptions. Their native assertions are not a safe execution contract. String repetition can overflow its allocation size from a tiny input.
* **Consequences**: Rust-generated List.get/head failures run cleanup and never load out-of-bounds storage. Shared C helpers independently report the same failures before access in debug and release builds; their legacy callers do not receive the Rust cleanup protocol. General error rendering and recoverable indexing APIs remain separate work. String.repeat permits at most 16,777,216 content bytes, checks before multiplication/allocation, and returns empty immediately for empty input or nonpositive counts. Rust checks before calling C so cleanup executes; the legacy C ABI independently rejects oversized requests with the same diagnostic and exit 1, without Rust's cleanup protocol. The REPL applies this language limit before its stricter interactive storage limit. No arbitrary error payload is printed as an address, and no failure is replaced with an empty string. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by the established decision format.

### 55 Define numeric domains and unwind runtime faults through cleanup
* **Date**: 2026-09-05
* **Status**: Accepted for Rust migration completion
* **Decision**: I will use wrapping Int arithmetic consistently, bounded exponentiation by squaring for nonnegative Int powers, IEEE Float power, and value-based Float list membership. Invalid integer division/remainder by zero or negative integer exponents produce controlled runtime diagnostics after deferred cleanup.
* **Context**: The existing REPL diagnoses zero division while native signed division can trap or vary by architecture. DESIGN's debug-overflow panic rule conflicts with its no-panic aspirations and the current wrapping interactive implementation. Fern's scalar operators retain scalar result types; invalid numeric domains need a defined execution failure rather than an arbitrary value or a hardware-dependent crash.
* **Consequences**: Generated functions receive an explicit fault context after their environment argument; closures receive the current caller's context and never capture a stack context. Fault checks dominate uses of function/callback results. Faulting paths run ordinary function cleanup, and the first fault wins even if cleanup also fails. Each cleanup callback runs with a cleared context, so remaining callbacks still execute. Main reports one diagnostic and exits 1. This introduces no mutable process-global state and changes neither source Function/Result types nor the C runtime ABI. Int::MIN divided by -1 wraps to MIN, with remainder 0; 0**0 is 1. Power is right-associative and retains existing unary precedence. Elixir-style bitwise operators &&&/|||/^^^/~~~/<<</>>> keep record-update and pipe delimiters distinct; shifts normalize counts modulo 64 and right shifts preserve the sign. General recoverable checked-arithmetic APIs remain a separate library requirement. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by the established decision format.

### 56 Preserve literal contents and document Unicode identifier spelling
* **Date**: 2026-09-05
* **Status**: Accepted for Rust migration completion
* **Decision**: I will parse base-prefixed integers with explicit digit/separator/range validation, preserve the exact contents of triple-quoted strings, and accept bounded nested block comments. Documentation attributes retain their declaration association. Non-ASCII non-whitespace identifier characters retain the C frontend's broad spelling compatibility, with exact UTF-8 identity and no normalization.
* **Context**: Fern specifies multiline strings, block comments, documentation attributes and full-width numeric values, while legacy lexical acceptance includes incomplete or malformed cases. Reusing ordinary strings' escapes/interpolation and retaining newline/indent bytes avoids implicit transformations. Bitwise token choices must coexist with record updates and pipes.
* **Consequences**: Unterminated comments/strings and invalid digits, separators or integer magnitudes are diagnostics. Case-insensitive 0x/0b/0o prefixes select bases; a leading minus permits the exact Int minimum. String contents do not undergo automatic dedenting. ASCII identifiers begin with a letter or underscore and continue with letters/digits/underscores; non-ASCII spelling is preserved exactly. Formatting must preserve parsed semantics, literal values, comments and documentation metadata. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by the established decision format.

### 54 Keep iteration lazy and error handlers concretely typed
* **Date**: 2026-09-05
* **Status**: Accepted for Rust migration completion
* **Decision**: I will represent ranges as immutable Int endpoints with an inclusive flag, iterate List/Map/Range values once in their defined order, and give each function its own stack of loop targets. With blocks will retain sequential checked steps and handlers specialized for each distinct error type.
* **Context**: Materializing a full-width integer range would allocate unbounded memory or overflow at an inclusive maximum endpoint. Fern specifies heterogeneous errors in with blocks; forcing them into one inferred error type would reject the documented control flow. Repeatedly nesting source-level matches would also turn a flat block into deep compiler recursion.
* **Consequences**: Empty or reversed ranges produce no iterations. Inclusive ranges test their final value before incrementing. Break and continue target the nearest loop in the same function and leave deferred cleanup registered until function exit. Map iteration follows insertion order and yields key/value tuples; list enumeration yields index/value tuples. With steps stop at the first error, each concrete handler preserves applicable source-arm order and requires exhaustiveness, and successful binders are unavailable in error handlers. Explicit error arms use Err(pattern) or an unbound wildcard; named catches use Err(name). Without else, errors propagate under the same enclosing Result constraint as postfix ?. No erased or fabricated Result payload types are introduced. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by the established decision format.

### 53 Preserve abrupt control flow and function-exit cleanup
* **Date**: 2026-09-05
* **Status**: Accepted for Rust migration completion
* **Decision**: I will represent early termination explicitly through checking, typed IR and native emission. Deferred expressions become captured zero-argument Unit closures registered dynamically on a function-owned LIFO stack. Every normal return, explicit return and propagated Result error saves its value before draining that stack.
* **Context**: Conditionals and match arms can leave a function without producing a value for their enclosing expression. Fabricated operands would execute skipped effects or create invalid native joins. The dedicated DESIGN cleanup section requires function-exit semantics, including registrations in inner blocks, rather than lexical-block cleanup.
* **Consequences**: Only live control-flow predecessors contribute values. Let-else binds success values into the following scope and requires its failure branch to diverge. Deferred expressions capture immutable lexical values at registration but evaluate their code, including call arguments, at function exit. Cleanup must produce Unit and cannot return or propagate errors; a mandatory cleanup closure may handle captured Results. User lambdas have independent return and cleanup contexts. Interactive evaluation uses a separate bounded cleanup work budget so ordinary evaluation failures can still attempt cleanup while preserving the original failure. Actor cleanup remains outside this contract. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by the established decision format.

### 52 Preserve immutable map and record-update semantics
* **Date**: 2026-09-05
* **Status**: Accepted for Rust migration completion
* **Decision**: I will implement maps with Int, Bool or String keys and arbitrary concrete values, using semantic key equality and immutable GC-managed pair storage. Entries iterate in insertion order; replacing a duplicate key keeps its position and the last value wins. Record updates evaluate their base and field expressions once in source order before constructing a fresh record.
* **Context**: Fern specifies Map literals and new/get/put/delete, but does not define key equality or ordering. The C runtime has no Map ABI, and its record-update emitter currently returns the unchanged base. Compiler-owned typed lowering gives native and interactive execution one explicit contract without inferring types from transport widths.
* **Consequences**: Map lookup and immutable updates initially take linear time; hashing is a later optimization behind the same semantics. Float and compound keys are rejected until an equality/hash contract is specified; values retain full-width Float, pointer, closure and Result representations. Deleting and reinserting a key appends it. Native tests use semantic expected output, including aliases, duplicate effects and record updates, rather than inheriting C's incomplete behavior. The source API also provides len/is_empty/contains/keys/values for inspection. Unknown or duplicate update fields are diagnostics. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by the established decision format.

### 51 Lift typed closures with explicit environments
* **Date**: 2026-09-05
* **Status**: Accepted for Rust migration completion
* **Decision**: I will infer function values through semantic Function types, specialize generic functions before lifting closures, and use a uniform hidden environment argument for generated functions. Closures retain a code pointer and full-width captured values in GC-managed storage. Higher-order builtins execute typed calls through this convention.
* **Context**: Fern's documented anonymous functions and functional collection operations require captures that survive their defining call. The legacy C callback ABI has neither an environment parameter nor complete Float/Option transport. The persistent REPL recompiles source definitions, so numeric function IDs alone cannot identify code across entries.
* **Consequences**: Captures and arguments evaluate once in source order; native Float payloads preserve their bits. Builtin and runtime function values receive concrete typed wrappers. Interactive closures retain their originating immutable checked program. Each lambda has its own return/error context. Capturing already-produced Result-bearing values is temporarily rejected because delayed callbacks may never execute; lifting this restriction requires ownership/effect tracking across closures, aliases and containers. Functions returning Results are not themselves unhandled Result values. C remains the default until full migration gates pass.

### 50 Make directory listing failures explicit in the source API
* **Date**: 2026-09-05
* **Status**: Accepted for the unreleased frontend migration
* **Decision**: I will change `fs.list_dir` and its `File.list_dir` alias from `List(String)` to `Result(List(String), Int)` in both frontends. Empty directories return `Ok([])`; filesystem failures return an error, never an empty or partial success.
* **Context**: The legacy native helper returned NULL for open failures even though the source type promised a List. This prevented safe Rust lowering and could cause invalid pointer access. The user authorized completing the pre-1.0 migration, including the implementation work needed to make failure handling reliable. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by this established decision format.
* **Consequences**: Callers must match, propagate, or otherwise handle the Result. Error codes distinguish missing paths, permission failures, non-directories, and other IO failures. Enumeration is bounded to 1,048,576 entries; exceeding that limit returns IO failure. The legacy nullable `fern_list_dir` C ABI remains, while source calls use `fern_read_dir_result`; Rust copies successful native StringLists into ordinary Lists. This is a breaking source change for the unreleased migration and must be announced with migration guidance; it must not be published as a backward-compatible patch or minor release under the compatibility policy.

### 49 Execute argument vectors without shell reconstruction
* **Date**: 2026-09-05
* **Status**: Accepted
* **Decision**: I will implement `System.exec_args` with `posix_spawnp` and literal argv, capturing stdout/stderr in private unlinked files.
* **Context**: The previous runtime reconstructed a shell command and underallocated its buffer when escaping single quotes. It contradicted the documented no-shell API and could corrupt memory.
* **Consequences**: Empty or missing commands and signal termination produce exit code -1; normal exit statuses and both streams are retained. Argument bytes never become shell syntax. Temporary capture descriptors are normalized above standard streams and closed after waiting; the separate `System.exec` API retains explicit shell semantics.

### 48 Preserve IEEE Float values across native and payload boundaries
* **Date**: 2026-09-05
* **Status**: Accepted
* **Decision**: I will lower Float as QBE double values, bitcast their 64-bit representation at generic collection/sum/record boundaries, and keep integer and floating arithmetic explicitly separate.
* **Context**: Fern specifies IEEE 754 doubles. Treating generic payload bits as numerical integers would corrupt values; raw-bit equality would mishandle signed zero and NaN.
* **Consequences**: Decimal/exponent literals, arithmetic/comparisons and printing use double semantics. Numeric literals must remain finite; runtime operations may produce IEEE infinities/NaNs. Printing uses system printf with 17 significant digits. Float List.contains remains rejected until value-aware lowering exists. Integer-to-Float coercion is not implicit.

### 47 Specialize generic code and preserve nominal type layouts
* **Date**: 2026-09-05
* **Status**: Accepted for Rust migration completion
* **Decision**: I will represent user types nominally, retain generic parameters in source syntax, and specialize generic functions and layouts into concrete typed IR. Custom sum/record values use GC-allocated storage containing a full-width discriminant and full-width fields; nested patterns inspect tags before reading payloads.
* **Context**: The user authorized completing the remaining migration milestones. Generic definitions and user types must scale beyond the initial built-in List/Option/Result cases while preserving the emitter's concrete-type boundary. The existing C runtime already exposes GC allocation.
* **Consequences**: Specialization, type expansion, and recursive matching are bounded and produce diagnostics when limits are exceeded. Runtime representations remain independent of source names; records use one constructor with named fields. Subsequent module loading must qualify declarations before type resolution. C remains available until executable-feature and tooling parity is verified. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by this established decision format.

### 46 Extend Rust through typed collections and built-in sum types
* **Date**: 2026-09-05
* **Status**: Accepted for the incremental Rust frontend
* **Decision**: I will extend the Rust pipeline with recursive concrete List/Option/Result types, checked constructor inference, immutable list operations, exhaustive pattern matching, and postfix Result propagation before adding user-defined generic types. Resolved IR must contain no inference variables.
* **Context**: The user authorized continuing the measured Rust migration. Compound values test the type/ABI boundary more meaningfully than adding isolated scalar syntax. Existing packed Option runtime functions truncate payloads to 32 bits and cannot safely carry Strings or full Fern Int values.
* **Consequences**: Rust Option values use the existing heap-backed Result allocation/tag/payload helpers internally (Some maps to Ok; None to Err with an unused zero payload). This preserves 64-bit payloads without changing the shipping C compiler or its packed Option ABI. Calls to C APIs returning packed Options remain unsupported until explicit adapters exist. Lists and Results reuse their existing runtime representations. Match checking initially supports scalar literals, catchalls, and built-in constructor patterns with binding/wildcard payloads; unsupported nested patterns/guards receive diagnostics. General custom types, generics, and wider tooling remain subsequent milestones. The unavailable `/decision` skill is replaced by this established decision format.

### 45 Evaluate a safe Rust frontend with typed IR and the existing native backend
* **Date**: 2026-09-05
* **Status**: Accepted experiment; shipping C frontend remains default
* **Decision**: I will implement an independent, dependency-free Rust 2021 frontend prototype in `compiler-rs`, carry resolved types and symbol IDs through a typed IR, and reuse the vendored QBE backend and C runtime through an isolated backend process. I will compare the supported subset against specification-grounded native-output fixtures and the C compiler before recommending broader migration.
* **Context**: The user authorized a measured Rust migration experiment, superseding decision 2's C-only restriction for this prototype. Recent type reconstruction and pointer-lifetime bugs justify evaluating stronger implementation guarantees without replacing working native features. The `/decision` skill is unavailable; the established decision format is used directly.
* **Consequences**: Rust uses standard owned types, enums, Vec, and Result; C-specific Datatype99/SDS/arena rules remain applicable to C. Safe Rust is required (`forbid(unsafe_code)`), runtime behavior and Fern syntax do not change, unsupported prototype constructs produce explicit diagnostics, and the old compiler remains available. Bounds and parser depth are enforced; idiomatic type-enforced invariants replace redundant Rust assertions. A small process boundary isolates QBE's global state/abort behavior and avoids Rust FFI ownership hazards. Benchmark frontend work separately from shared backend/link work.

### 44 Verify native diagnostics before replacing the reference checker
* **Date**: 2026-09-05
* **Status**: Accepted
* **Decision**: I will require exact diagnostic multisets and exit codes on pinned failing fixtures and repository source before claiming native checker diagnostic parity; Python remains the default until the complete build/git/CLI workflow is validated.
* **Context**: Comparing successful exit codes alone hid missing checks and a native main function that always exited successfully.
* **Consequences**: CI requires diagnostic parity; full checker replacement remains an explicit open task. String constants use bounded printable runs and numeric unsafe bytes to preserve assembler-independent content and avoid truncation.

### 43 Actor invariants and explicit executable-feature boundaries
* **Date**: 2026-09-05
* **Status**: Accepted
* **Decision**: I will enforce acyclic single-owner supervision, one replacement per dead PID, zero-safe restart windows, and stopped-sibling preservation. Native build/run will reject unimplemented spawn/receive execution with actionable diagnostics while parse/check can still inspect planned syntax.
* **Context**: Runtime defects violated existing lifecycle promises; code generation previously created actor records without executing functions and evaluated receive arms without receiving messages. Those successful compilations concealed incorrect behavior.
* **Consequences**: Mailbox APIs remain executable, `send` preserves its real Result, and unsupported actor execution fails clearly. Full scheduling and descendant supervision are still required. Rejected registrations leave state unchanged; normal/shutdown children stay stopped unless explicitly restarted.

### 42 Relocatable compiler bundles and isolated run artifacts
* **Date**: 2026-09-05
* **Status**: Accepted
* **Decision**: I will install the runtime archive beside the compiler, resolve the actual executable location for runtime lookup, quote filesystem paths passed to the system toolchain, and create a private temporary directory for each `fern run` invocation.
* **Context**: Installing only the compiler and resolving argv[0] failed outside the checkout; unquoted paths broke ordinary directory names; predictable run paths could overwrite unrelated files. The `/decision` skill is unavailable in this checkout/session, so this entry follows the existing decision format directly.
* **Consequences**: Bundles remain relocatable, `PREFIX` supports local installation, and simultaneous runs have separate artifacts. Native compilation still requires the documented host compiler and libraries.

### 41 Deterministic terminal UI composition and interactive editing
* **Date**: 2026-09-05
* **Status**: Accepted
* **Decision**: I will reuse vendored linenoise for interactive prompt editing, preserve plain line reads for pipes, compose immutable trees with `new`, `add`, and `render`, expose deterministic log formatters, and emit cursor controls only on terminals.
* **Context**: Existing terminal modules need structured output and usable editing without another dependency or timing-dependent tests. The `/decision` skill is unavailable; this entry follows the existing format directly.
* **Consequences**: PTY tests cover interactive behavior and deterministic output fixtures cover trees/logs. Redirected output remains suitable for scripts.

### 40 Erlang-pattern hardening pass: explicit link context, deterministic supervision clock, and strategy child tables
* **Date**: 2026-02-06
* **Status**: ✅ Accepted
* **Decision**: I will harden actor supervision semantics by (1) requiring explicit current-process context for `spawn_link`, (2) adding `actors.demonitor` plus normal-exit classification (`normal`/`shutdown` do not auto-restart), (3) switching restart-intensity timing to a deterministic runtime clock API, and (4) implementing supervisor child-table-driven `one_for_all`/`rest_for_one` strategies alongside `one_for_one`.
* **Context**: The baseline supervision implementation was functionally useful but still fragile relative to Erlang/OTP behavior: implicit link-parent selection, no demonitor path, wall-clock-dependent restart windows, and no multi-child strategy semantics. The next reliability step required algorithmic behavior improvements rather than API renaming.
* **Consequences**: Runtime now exposes `fern_actor_set_current/fern_actor_self`, `fern_actor_clock_set/advance/now`, `fern_actor_demonitor`, `fern_actor_supervise_one_for_all`, and `fern_actor_supervise_rest_for_one`; checker/codegen now type-check/lower the new `actors.*` APIs; and supervisor child tables track child ids/order/strategy to drive restart targeting. Coverage is anchored by `test_runtime_actor_spawn_link_requires_current_actor_contract`, `test_runtime_actor_demonitor_stops_down_notifications_contract`, `test_runtime_actor_supervision_uses_deterministic_clock_contract`, `test_runtime_actor_supervise_one_for_all_restarts_all_children_contract`, and `test_runtime_actor_supervise_rest_for_one_restarts_suffix_contract`.

### 39 Erlang-style process lifecycle baseline: exited PIDs become dead and non-routable
* **Date**: 2026-02-06
* **Status**: ✅ Accepted
* **Decision**: I will enforce Erlang-inspired process lifecycle semantics where `fern_actor_exit` transitions a process to a dead PID state, dead actors reject send/receive/mailbox/scheduler participation, and manual `fern_actor_restart` is allowed only from dead actors.
* **Context**: Supervision intensity and monitor/restart contracts were in place, but exited actors remained routable in runtime state, which violated core process semantics and made supervision behavior less reliable. We needed a concrete lifecycle boundary so supervision algorithms operate on real process death, not soft notifications.
* **Consequences**: Runtime actor records now track alive/dead state. `fern_actor_send`, `fern_actor_receive`, `fern_actor_mailbox_len`, scheduler selection, `fern_actor_monitor`, and `fern_actor_supervise` all require live actors. `fern_actor_exit` marks actors dead before notifications/restart handling, and `fern_actor_restart` now requires a dead source actor id. Coverage is anchored by `test_runtime_actor_exit_marks_actor_dead_contract`.

### 38 Erlang-inspired actor monitoring baseline: `DOWN(...)` notifications + explicit restart primitive
* **Date**: 2026-02-06
* **Status**: ✅ Accepted
* **Decision**: I will model monitor behavior after Erlang by adding one-way monitor registrations that emit `DOWN(pid, reason)` messages on exit, while keeping linked-exit `Exit(pid, reason)` delivery and adding an explicit `actors.restart(pid)` primitive for baseline supervision workflows.
* **Context**: The prior supervision slice introduced `spawn_link` and linked exit notifications, but did not cover monitor semantics or restart APIs. We needed a practical, test-first step that reflects Erlang process semantics closely enough for adoption while staying within current runtime constraints (mailbox/scheduler baseline, no full supervisor tree policies yet).
* **Consequences**: Checker/codegen/runtime now expose `actors.monitor(Int, Int) -> Result(Int, Int)` and `actors.restart(Int) -> Result(Int, Int)`, runtime stores monitor registrations per actor, `fern_actor_exit` emits `DOWN(...)` to monitors and `Exit(...)` to linked parents, and restart returns a new actor id preserving name/link baseline and monitor registrations. Coverage is anchored by `test_check_actors_monitor_returns_result`, `test_check_actors_restart_returns_result`, `test_codegen_actors_monitor_calls_runtime`, `test_codegen_actors_restart_calls_runtime`, and `test_runtime_actor_monitor_and_restart_contract`.

### 37 Milestone 8 supervision baseline with `spawn_link` and linked `Exit(...)` notification
* **Date**: 2026-02-06
* **Status**: ✅ Accepted
* **Decision**: I will add a first supervision contract now by supporting `spawn_link(fn)` in checker/codegen and runtime linked-exit delivery via `fern_actor_exit`, with deterministic baseline linking to the most recently spawned actor id.
* **Context**: Gate D passed and roadmap focus shifted to milestone polish, but supervision remained an unstarted milestone gap even though the language design documents `spawn_link`/`Exit(...)` behavior. We needed a minimal, testable slice that introduces supervision semantics without waiting for full actor-process execution and restart machinery.
* **Consequences**: `spawn_link(...)` now type-checks and lowers to `fern_actor_spawn_link`, runtime actor records track a linked parent id, and `fern_actor_exit(actor_id, reason)` enqueues `Exit(actor_id, reason)` messages to the linked supervisor mailbox. Coverage is anchored by `test_check_spawn_link_returns_int`, `test_codegen_spawn_link_calls_runtime`, and `test_runtime_actor_spawn_link_exit_notification_contract`. Full monitor/restart policies remain future milestone work.

### 36 Civetweb runtime backend for `http.get`/`http.post` (ship now)
* **Date**: 2026-02-06
* **Status**: ✅ Accepted
* **Decision**: I will implement Fern's HTTP runtime backend using vendored civetweb now, replacing placeholder `Err(FERN_ERR_IO)` behavior for successful HTTP requests.
* **Context**: The stdlib HTTP surface (`http.get`, `http.post`) was already stabilized in checker/codegen and only lacked runtime execution. We considered layered socket/parser composition versus a single dependency and prioritized the "best option now" for maturity, auditability, and delivery speed.
* **Consequences**: Runtime now performs real HTTP client requests via civetweb and returns `Ok(response_body)` on `2xx` responses; invalid URLs, non-`2xx` responses, and transport failures return `Err(FERN_ERR_IO)`. Civetweb v1.16 is vendored under `deps/civetweb`, runtime build/link paths include civetweb + pthread/OpenSSL requirements, and runtime-surface coverage includes local loopback GET/POST success tests (`tests/test_runtime_surface.c`). HTTPS/TLS is enabled in the runtime build.

### 35 SQLite-first SQL runtime backend with libsql-compatible API surface
* **Date**: 2026-02-06
* **Status**: ✅ Accepted
* **Decision**: I will implement `sql.open` and `sql.execute` on top of SQLite (`sqlite3`) first, while keeping Fern's SQL API surface stable so we can layer or swap to libsql later without changing Fern source signatures.
* **Context**: The runtime previously returned placeholder `Err(FERN_ERR_IO)` for all SQL calls, which created a major product-surface gap even though `sql.*` type signatures were stabilized. Integrating full libsql transport/features immediately would add substantial dependency and packaging complexity. A SQLite-first backend delivers concrete local database behavior now and keeps progress aligned with current Gate C stabilization priorities.
* **Consequences**: `fern_sql_open` now returns opaque handle ids for opened SQLite connections and `fern_sql_execute` returns rows affected via `sqlite3_changes()`. Runtime/link paths now include `sqlite3` linkage, and runtime-surface tests now cover successful SQL create/insert flows plus invalid-handle errors. HTTP remains placeholder-backed until its runtime backend lands.

### 34 Gate C actor runtime core baseline: FIFO mailbox + round-robin scheduler tickets
* **Date**: 2026-02-06
* **Status**: ✅ Accepted
* **Decision**: I will implement Gate C actor runtime core as an in-memory runtime with per-actor FIFO mailboxes and a round-robin scheduler queue driven by send-time scheduler tickets, exposed through `fern_actor_spawn/send/receive/mailbox_len/scheduler_next` with `start/post/next` compatibility aliases.
* **Context**: Gate C Task 2 required concrete runtime behavior for `spawn`, `send`, `receive`, and scheduler operations, not placeholder acknowledgments. Existing actor runtime only returned monotonic ids, dropped posted messages, and returned `Err(FERN_ERR_IO)` for reads. We needed deterministic semantics that can be regression-tested immediately and used by both Fern stdlib calls and runtime C-ABI tests.
* **Consequences**: Runtime actor APIs now provide mailbox FIFO delivery and deterministic scheduler ordering (`a, b, a` shape for the covered scenario) while preserving compatibility for `actors.start/post/next`. Coverage is anchored in `tests/test_runtime_surface.c` via `test_runtime_actors_post_and_next_mailbox_contract` and `test_runtime_actor_scheduler_round_robin_contract`, and compatibility docs are updated to treat this as Gate C baseline behavior.

### 33 Step D memory-path selection for first WASM target
* **Date**: 2026-02-06
* **Status**: ✅ Accepted
* **Decision**: I will choose Perceus baseline (compiler-inserted `dup/drop` + RC headers) as the default memory path for Fern's first WASM target, keep Boehm bridge as an explicit temporary fallback for bring-up only, and defer WasmGC as a non-default option.
* **Context**: Milestone 7.7 Step D required measured comparison and a concrete default/fallback decision. The repository now has Step A-C primitives and constrained codegen insertion, but no shipping WASM backend yet. Step D measurements were captured via `scripts/compare_memory_paths.py` in `docs/reports/memory-path-comparison-2026-02-06.md`, including native perf snapshot, ownership-op microbenchmark (`fern_dup/drop` vs `fern_rc_dup/drop`), and local WASM/WasmGC feasibility probes.
* **Consequences**: The project advances to actor runtime work with memory-path direction settled for first WASM implementation. Future WASM work should implement backend/toolchain integration against Perceus default, use Boehm bridge only for short-lived bring-up, and re-run the Step D comparison artifact once real WASM binaries are produced.

### 32 Constrained Step C dup/drop insertion in codegen
* **Date**: 2026-02-06
* **Status**: ✅ Accepted
* **Decision**: I will implement initial dup/drop insertion in codegen only for a constrained, test-covered subset: pointer alias let-bindings (`let y = x`) emit `fern_dup`, and function-scope owned pointer names emit `fern_drop` at return sites with returned-identifier preservation.
* **Context**: Milestone 7.7 Step C requires proving end-to-end codegen insertion before full ownership analysis. A broad first pass (all expressions/scopes/branches) would be high-risk and hard to validate in one step.
* **Consequences**: Fern now emits semantic `dup/drop` calls for simple pointer ownership flows while keeping behavior deterministic under the current Boehm bridge. Coverage is anchored by focused codegen regression tests in `tests/test_codegen.c` (`test_codegen_dup_inserted_for_pointer_alias_binding`, `test_codegen_drop_inserted_for_unreturned_pointer_bindings`), and broader ownership inference remains future work.

### 31 Perceus object header contract for core runtime heap values
* **Date**: 2026-02-06
* **Status**: ✅ Accepted
* **Decision**: I will add a stable Perceus-style object header API (`fern_rc_alloc`, `fern_rc_dup`, `fern_rc_drop`, and metadata accessors) and tag core runtime heap allocations (`Result`, `List`, `StringList`) with explicit RC type tags.
* **Context**: Milestone 7.7 Step B requires concrete runtime object metadata and refcount operations so later codegen work can insert dup/drop in a verifiable way. Step A only established abstraction entry points (`alloc/dup/drop`) without object header semantics or typed heap metadata.
* **Consequences**: Runtime now exposes header-level refcount/type/flag queries and updates, and core heap constructors use RC-tagged allocations while memory reclamation remains Boehm-driven for now. Compatibility and C-ABI regression coverage are extended in `tests/test_runtime_surface.c` (`test_runtime_rc_header_and_core_type_ops`).

### 30 Runtime memory API: `alloc/dup/drop` abstraction with Boehm bridge
* **Date**: 2026-02-06
* **Status**: ✅ Accepted
* **Decision**: I will standardize runtime memory ownership operations on `fern_alloc`, `fern_dup`, and `fern_drop`, with `fern_free` retained as a compatibility alias to `fern_drop`.
* **Context**: Milestone 7.7 Step A requires an explicit memory abstraction surface before Perceus object headers and codegen dup/drop insertion land. The runtime already had `fern_alloc`/`fern_free`, but no ownership-duplication primitive or stable drop semantics that future RC backends can target.
* **Consequences**: Boehm-backed runtime now exposes stable `dup/drop` symbols with no-op ownership semantics under GC while preserving API shape for future RC backends. C-ABI regression coverage for this contract is added in `tests/test_runtime_surface.c`.

### 29 Stabilize Gate C placeholder runtime behavior with error-return semantics
* **Date**: 2026-02-06
* **Status**: ✅ Accepted
* **Decision**: I will make Gate C placeholder runtime functions return deterministic `Err(FERN_ERR_IO)` results for unsupported or invalid placeholder paths, instead of aborting via assertions on user-provided empty inputs.
* **Context**: Task 1 stabilization required runtime behavior to be documented and regression-tested, not only checker/codegen symbol mapping. Existing placeholder functions (`json.parse`, `json.stringify`, `http.get`, `sql.open`) aborted on empty-string inputs in debug builds, which broke API predictability and testability.
* **Consequences**: Runtime placeholder contracts are now explicit in `docs/COMPATIBILITY_POLICY.md` and covered by `tests/test_runtime_surface.c`. Empty-input behavior is stable (no abort), and future runtime implementations can evolve behind these contracts with compatibility tracking.

### 28 Standardize stdlib entry points to fs/json/http/sql/actors
* **Date**: 2026-02-06
* **Status**: ✅ Accepted
* **Decision**: I will stabilize `fs`, `json`, `http`, `sql`, and `actors` as Fern's top-level stdlib entry points, while keeping `File.*` as a compatibility alias during migration.
* **Context**: Gate C requires a predictable product surface before deeper runtime work. The compiler already exposed mixed module names (`File`, `System`, `Regex`, `Tui.*`) and lacked a consistent contract for the next stdlib modules. We need a clear API front door now so future runtime implementation work can proceed without renaming churn.
* **Consequences**: Checker/codegen now recognize the stabilized entry points and are covered by regression tests. `File.*` remains supported for compatibility and will follow the formal deprecation policy if retired. Runtime semantics for the new module surfaces can evolve behind these stable names.

### 27 WASM memory strategy: Perceus target, Boehm bridge
* **Date**: 2026-02-06
* **Status**: ✅ Accepted ⬆️ Supersedes [26]
* **Decision**: I will keep Boehm GC as the shipping memory system for native in the short term, use it only as an optional bridge for early WASM bring-up, and keep Perceus-style compile-time reference counting as Fern's long-term memory model for both native and WASM.
* **Context**: Decision [26] assumed Boehm GC could not support WASM. Upstream Boehm now includes explicit WebAssembly (`WEBASSEMBLY`) support paths for Emscripten and WASI, but with practical constraints (notably wasm32 assumptions and limited threading support). Fern still needs deterministic memory behavior, predictable pauses, and a unified actor-friendly model, which align better with Perceus. We also need an incremental path that does not block Gate C work.
* **Consequences**: Milestone 7.7 becomes a concrete engineering spike with exit criteria (prototype both Boehm-on-WASM and Perceus runtime shape, compare pause behavior, binary size, and implementation risk). Decision [26] is superseded for the "Boehm cannot support WASM" claim, but Perceus remains the preferred end-state.

### 26 Perceus-style reference counting for WASM support
* **Date**: 2026-01-29
* **Status**: 🔄 Superseded by [27]
* **Decision**: I will implement Perceus-style compile-time reference counting as Fern's long-term memory management strategy, replacing Boehm GC for both native and WASM targets.
* **Context**: Boehm GC works well for native targets but cannot support WASM (relies on stack scanning and OS features). Considered several alternatives: (1) Rust-style ownership - powerful but steep learning curve, (2) Swift ARC - requires manual weak references for cycles, (3) WasmGC - ties us to browser GC, may have pauses, (4) Perceus (from Koka/Roc) - reference counting with reuse optimization. Chose Perceus because: functional purity eliminates cycles (no weak refs needed), zero developer annotations required, works identically on native and WASM, no GC pauses, and enables "functional but in-place" optimization where unique values are mutated behind the scenes.
* **Consequences**: Created `docs/MEMORY_MANAGEMENT.md` with detailed design. Implementation in phases: (1) Keep Boehm for now, (2) Add Perceus for WASM target, (3) Replace Boehm everywhere, (4) Add reuse optimization. Compiler will insert dup/drop operations automatically. Developers write pure functional code; compiler figures out optimal memory strategy.

### 25 Four Pillars philosophy - joy, one way, no surprises, jetpack
* **Date**: 2026-01-29
* **Status**: ✅ Adopted
* **Decision**: I will design Fern around four core pillars: (1) Spark Joy - FP should feel delightful, (2) One Obvious Way - avoid "many ways to do it" confusion, (3) No Surprises - prevent bugs that waste debugging time, (4) Jetpack Included - batteries included like Bun/Elixir.
* **Context**: Needed to articulate what makes Fern distinctive beyond just "functional + Python syntax". The four pillars capture the user experience goals: joy for FP practitioners, clarity for teams, safety by default, and productivity through included batteries. This philosophy influences every design decision - from syntax choices to stdlib scope to error messages.
* **Consequences**: README and DESIGN.md updated with philosophy. All future features evaluated against these pillars. "No surprises" particularly important - we actively prevent null, unhandled errors, race conditions, silent failures. "One obvious way" means we document idioms clearly and avoid redundant features. "Jetpack" means stdlib includes actors, DB, HTTP, TUI, CLI tools - not just basics.

### 24 Tui.* nested module namespace for terminal UI
* **Date**: 2026-01-29
* **Status**: ✅ Adopted
* **Decision**: I will organize all terminal UI modules under a `Tui.*` namespace (e.g., `Tui.Panel`, `Tui.Table`, `Tui.Style`) instead of using flat top-level module names.
* **Context**: The original flat module names (`Panel`, `Table`, `Style`, `Status`, `Live`, `Progress`, `Spinner`, `Term`) were ambiguous - `Style` could mean anything, `Panel`/`Table` aren't clearly TUI-related at a glance, and `Term` (terminal capabilities) belongs with other TUI modules. Considered two approaches: (1) Keep flat names - simple but poor organization and discoverability, (2) Nested `Tui.*` namespace - groups related functionality, follows Elixir's convention (e.g., `Phoenix.HTML`, `Ecto.Query`), makes it clear these are terminal UI modules. The nested approach also prepares the language for future namespace organization (e.g., `Http.*`, `Json.*`, `Crypto.*`). Implemented proper nested module support using `try_build_module_path()` helper that recursively builds paths from dot expressions, enabling arbitrary nesting depth.
* **Consequences**: All TUI modules renamed: `Term` → `Tui.Term`, `Panel` → `Tui.Panel`, `Table` → `Tui.Table`, `Style` → `Tui.Style`, `Status` → `Tui.Status`, `Live` → `Tui.Live`, `Progress` → `Tui.Progress`, `Spinner` → `Tui.Spinner`. Both checker.c and codegen.c updated to recognize nested module paths. Examples updated to use new namespace. The module system now supports arbitrary nesting (e.g., `Tui.Style.Colors` would work if implemented). DESIGN.md updated with comprehensive Tui module documentation.

### 23 Embedded QBE compiler backend
* **Date**: 2026-01-29
* **Status**: ✅ Adopted
* **Decision**: I will embed QBE directly into the fern binary rather than requiring it as an external dependency.
* **Context**: The fern compiler was calling external `qbe` binary via system() which required users to install QBE separately. This conflicted with the "single binary" philosophy. Considered options: (1) Keep external qbe - simple but adds dependency, (2) Embed QBE source - removes dependency, single binary, (3) Use LLVM - powerful but massive dependency, (4) Write custom backend - flexible but huge effort. QBE is only ~6,650 lines of C with no dependencies, making it ideal for embedding. Modified QBE's main.c to expose `qbe_compile()` library function.
* **Consequences**: QBE source added to `deps/qbe/` (~16 files, 6.6K lines). Fern binary increased from ~200KB to ~540KB. Users no longer need to install qbe. The fern binary is now fully self-contained for development - only needs a C compiler (cc/clang) for assembling and linking, which is standard on all Unix systems.

### 22 Boehm GC for automatic memory management
* **Date**: 2026-01-29
* **Status**: ✅ Adopted
* **Decision**: I will use Boehm GC for automatic garbage collection in Fern programs, with a future path to BEAM-style per-process heaps when actors are implemented.
* **Context**: Fern's immutable-first, functional style generates many intermediate values (strings, lists, etc.) that need automatic memory management. Considered several approaches: (1) Manual memory management - error-prone, leaks inevitable, (2) Reference counting - works but has cycles problem and overhead, (3) Boehm GC - conservative, drop-in replacement for malloc, proven in production, (4) Custom tracing GC - complex, takes months to implement well, (5) BEAM-style per-process heaps - ideal for actors but requires actor runtime first. Chose Boehm GC as the pragmatic v1 solution: ~100 lines of integration, zero memory leaks, works with C FFI. When actors are added (Milestone 8), we'll transition to per-process heaps where each actor has its own GC'd heap - this eliminates global GC pauses and enables instant memory reclamation on process death.
* **Consequences**: Runtime uses `GC_MALLOC` instead of `malloc`. All `_free()` functions become no-ops. Compiled programs link with `-lgc`. Requires `brew install bdw-gc` (macOS) or `apt install libgc-dev` (Linux). Binary size increased ~20KB. No measurable performance impact in benchmarks. Future actor runtime will use per-process heaps with generational collection within each process.

### 21 Built-in module syntax for standard functions
* **Date**: 2026-01-29
* **Status**: ✅ Adopted
* **Decision**: I will use `Module.function()` syntax for built-in functions instead of flat names like `str_len()`, organized into `String`, `List`, `File`, `Result`, and `Option` modules.
* **Context**: The original flat naming convention (`str_len`, `str_concat`, `list_get`, `file_read`) works but has discoverability issues. Users can't easily find what functions are available without memorizing prefixes. Considered two approaches: (1) Keep flat names - simple but poor discoverability, (2) Module-qualified syntax `String.len()` - familiar from many languages, enables LSP autocomplete on `String.`, groups related functions clearly. The module approach is foundational for the language to "feel right" and prepares for future LSP integration where typing `String.` shows all available string functions.
* **Consequences**: Added `is_builtin_module()` and `lookup_module_function()` in checker.c. Updated EXPR_DOT handling to recognize module access. Added codegen support for module.function calls. Old flat names still work for backwards compatibility. All examples updated to use new syntax. DESIGN.md documents the built-in modules. Future: deprecation warnings for old syntax, eventual removal.

### 20 Optional return type for main() (Rust-style)
* **Date**: 2026-01-29
* **Status**: ✅ Adopted
* **Decision**: I will allow omitting the return type for `main()` only, defaulting to Unit with automatic `ret 0`.
* **Context**: Writing `fn main() -> Int: 0` for simple programs that don't need a return value is tedious. Rust allows both `fn main()` (Unit return) and `fn main() -> Result<(), E>` (explicit return). We adopt a similar approach: `fn main():` defaults to Unit return and auto-returns 0 (success exit code), while `fn main() -> Int:` requires an explicit integer return. This special case applies ONLY to main() - other functions still require explicit return types or use type inference. This provides ergonomic shorthand for scripts and simple programs while maintaining explicitness for library code.
* **Consequences**: The type checker treats `main()` with no return type as returning Unit. The code generator emits `ret 0` for main() with Unit return. Both `fn main():` and `fn main() -> Int:` are valid. Other functions are unaffected.

### 19 Deterministic simulation testing for actors (FernSim)
* **Date**: 2026-01-28
* **Status**: ✅ Accepted
* **Decision**: I will implement deterministic simulation testing (FernSim) for the actor runtime and supervision trees, inspired by TigerBeetle's VOPR and FoundationDB's simulation testing.
* **Context**: To achieve BEAM-level reliability for Fern's actor system, real-world testing is insufficient - it would take years to hit rare edge cases. Deterministic simulation can explore millions of process scheduling interleavings, inject faults (crashes, timeouts, message loss), and reproduce any bug with a seed. TigerBeetle found critical bugs in 3 weeks that would have taken 5+ years to find in production. FoundationDB credits simulation testing for their legendary reliability.
* **Consequences**: FernSim will be a core part of Milestone 8 (Actor Runtime). The actor scheduler must support both real execution and simulated execution with a deterministic PRNG. All supervision strategies (one_for_one, one_for_all, rest_for_one) will be verified against fault injection. CI will run simulation tests on every PR. Success criteria: 1M+ simulated steps with zero invariant violations before release.

### 18 HexDocs-style documentation generation
* **Date**: 2026-01-28
* **Status**: ✅ Accepted
* **Decision**: I will implement automatic documentation generation with two systems: (1) a built-in `fern doc` command for Fern code that generates HTML from `@doc` comments, and (2) a custom doc generator for the C compiler source code.
* **Context**: Good documentation is essential for adoption. Considered several approaches: (1) Doxygen for C code - industry standard but dated look, (2) Sphinx + Breathe - modern but complex setup, (3) Custom solution - tailored to our needs. For Fern language docs, a built-in command like `cargo doc` or `mix docs` provides the best developer experience. For compiler docs, a custom solution lets us match FERN_STYLE conventions and maintain a consistent look across both documentation systems.
* **Consequences**: Need to implement `fern doc` command that parses `@doc` comments and generates searchable HTML. Need to build a C doc extractor that understands our comment conventions. Both should share HTML templates for consistent styling. Documentation generation will be added to CI to keep docs up-to-date.

### 17 Unicode and emoji identifiers
* **Date**: 2026-01-28
* **Status**: ✅ Accepted
* **Decision**: I will allow Unicode letters and emojis as valid variable/function names, following Unicode identifier standards (XID_Start/XID_Continue) plus emoji support.
* **Context**: The question arose whether to restrict identifiers to ASCII or allow broader Unicode. Considered: (1) ASCII-only - simple but excludes international developers and mathematical notation, (2) Unicode letters only (XID categories) - allows π, θ, non-Latin scripts but not emojis, (3) Full Unicode + emojis - maximum expressiveness. Chose option 3 because it's the developer's choice to use identifiers responsibly. Languages like Swift and Julia allow emoji identifiers. While there are practical concerns (typing difficulty, rendering inconsistency, searchability), these are tradeoffs developers can evaluate for themselves.
* **Consequences**: The lexer must recognize Unicode XID_Start/XID_Continue categories plus emoji codepoints as valid identifier characters. DESIGN.md will document identifier rules. Test cases will verify Unicode identifiers work correctly (e.g., `let π = 3.14159`, `let 🚀 = launch()`).

### 16 Adopting TigerBeetle-inspired FERN_STYLE
* **Date**: 2026-01-28
* **Status**: ✅ Adopted
* **Decision**: I will adopt a coding style guide inspired by TigerBeetle's TIGER_STYLE, with emphasis on assertion density, function size limits, and fuzzing-friendly code.
* **Context**: TigerBeetle's engineering practices produce extremely reliable code through: (1) minimum 2 assertions per function, (2) 70-line function limit, (3) pair assertions for critical operations, (4) compile-time assertions, (5) explicit bounds on everything. These practices align well with AI-assisted development because they make invariants explicit, keep functions small enough for AI context windows, and enable effective fuzzing. The VOPR-style deterministic simulation testing approach will be adapted as FernFuzz for grammar-based compiler testing.
* **Consequences**: Created FERN_STYLE.md as the coding standard. All code must meet assertion density requirements. Functions over 70 lines must be split. Fuzzing infrastructure (FernFuzz) will be added to test lexer/parser with random programs. CI will enforce style compliance.

### 15 No named tuples (use records for named fields)
* **Date**: 2026-01-28
* **Status**: ✅ Adopted
* **Decision**: I will not support named tuple syntax `(x: 10, y: 20)`. Use positional tuples `(10, 20)` or declared records for named fields.
* **Context**: Named tuples create confusion because they look like records but aren't declared types. Users wouldn't know when to choose named tuples vs records. Keeping a clear distinction simplifies the mental model: tuples are positional and anonymous `(a, b, c)`, records are declared with `type` and have named fields. If you need named fields, declare a type.
* **Consequences**: Tuple syntax is positional only: `(10, 20)`. Named fields require a `type` declaration. Simpler grammar, clearer semantics, no ambiguity about tuple vs record.

### 14 No unless keyword
* **Date**: 2026-01-28
* **Status**: ✅ Adopted
* **Decision**: I will not include `unless` as a keyword. Use `if not` for negated conditions.
* **Context**: `unless` (from Ruby) is redundant with `if not` and adds cognitive overhead. Developers must mentally negate the condition to understand `unless`. It's especially confusing with already-negated conditions: `unless not ready`. Most Ruby style guides recommend avoiding `unless` with negations. Having one way to express conditionals (`if`) keeps the language simpler.
* **Consequences**: Only `if` for conditionals. Postfix conditionals use `if`: `return early if condition`. Negation uses `if not condition`. One less keyword to parse and teach.

### 13 No while or loop constructs (Gleam-style)
* **Date**: 2026-01-28
* **Status**: ✅ Adopted
* **Decision**: I will not include `while` or `loop` constructs. Stateful iteration uses recursion with tail-call optimization.
* **Context**: `while` and `loop` require mutable state between iterations, which conflicts with immutability. The semantics of rebinding inside loops are unclear and error-prone. Gleam takes the same approach: no loops, use recursion. Tail-call optimization makes recursion efficient. `for` loops over collections are kept since they don't require mutation - they're just iteration. Functional combinators (`fold`, `map`, `filter`, `find`) handle most cases elegantly.
* **Consequences**: Remove `while` and `loop` from grammar. Keep `for` for collection iteration. Recursion is the primary mechanism for stateful iteration. The lexer doesn't need TOKEN_WHILE or TOKEN_LOOP. Simplifies the language considerably.

### 12 Elixir-style record update syntax
* **Date**: 2026-01-28
* **Status**: ✅ Adopted
* **Decision**: I will use `%{ record | field: value }` syntax for record updates instead of `{ record | field: value }`.
* **Context**: The original `{ record | field: value }` syntax conflicts with the "no braces" philosophy - Fern uses indentation, not braces, for control flow. Using `%{...}` for record updates matches map literal syntax `%{"key": value}` and is inspired by Elixir. This creates consistency: both maps and record updates use `%{...}`.
* **Consequences**: Record update syntax is `%{ user | age: 31 }`. Map literals are `%{"key": value}`. Braces without `%` are not used.

### 11 Using ? operator for Result propagation
* **Date**: 2026-01-28
* **Status**: ✅ Adopted ⬆️ Supersedes [10]
* **Decision**: I will use the `?` operator (Rust-style, postfix) for Result propagation, keeping `<-` only inside `with` expressions.
* **Context**: After writing real examples, the postfix `?` works better than prefix `<-` because: (1) you see WHAT might fail before the `?`, not after, (2) it's familiar from Rust which is widely known, (3) it chains naturally `foo()?.bar()?.baz()?`, (4) it integrates cleanly with `let` bindings: `let x = fallible()?`. The `<-` syntax is preserved only inside `with` blocks for complex error handling, similar to Haskell's do-notation where `<-` is scoped.
* **Consequences**: The lexer needs `?` as TOKEN_QUESTION. The `<-` token (TOKEN_BIND) is only valid inside `with` blocks. Simple error propagation uses `let x = f()?`, complex handling uses `with x <- f(), ...`.

### 10 Using <- operator instead of ?
* **Date**: 2026-01-27
* **Status**: ⛔ Deprecated by [11]
* **Decision**: I will use the `<-` operator for Result binding instead of the `?` operator.
* **Context**: Initially considered Rust's `?` operator (postfix), but this has clarity issues: (1) it comes at the END of the expression, so you don't immediately see that an operation can fail, (2) `?` is overloaded in many languages (ternary, optional, etc.), making it less obvious. The `<-` operator (from Gleam/Roc) addresses both issues: it comes FIRST so failure is immediately visible, it reads naturally as "content comes from read_file", and it's not overloaded with other meanings.
* **Consequences**: All error handling examples use `<-` syntax. The lexer must recognize `<-` as a distinct token. Error messages reference `<-` in explanations.

### 9 No panics or crashes
* **Date**: 2026-01-27
* **Status**: ✅ Adopted
* **Decision**: I will eliminate all panic mechanisms from Fern - programs never crash from error conditions.
* **Context**: Many languages (Rust, Go, Swift) include panic/crash mechanisms for "impossible" errors. However, panics are the worst possible behavior: they're unpredictable, lose all error context, and can't be recovered from. In server scenarios, a panic can take down the entire application. Instead, ALL errors must be represented as `Result` types that force handling. There is no `.unwrap()`, no `panic()`, no `assert()` in production code.
* **Consequences**: The compiler must enforce that all `Result` values are handled. Error types must be comprehensive enough to represent all failure modes. Standard library functions that might fail must return `Result`. Debug builds can use `debug_assert()` for development.

### 8 Actor-based concurrency model
* **Date**: 2026-01-27
* **Status**: ✅ Adopted
* **Decision**: I will use an actor-based concurrency model (Erlang/Elixir style) instead of threads, async/await, or channels.
* **Context**: Considered several options: (1) OS threads - too heavy, difficult to reason about shared state, (2) async/await - complex, color functions, can't block, (3) Go-style goroutines with channels - better but still allows shared memory bugs, (4) Actor model - isolated processes with message passing only, no shared memory, supervisor trees for fault tolerance. The actor model provides the best balance of safety and expressiveness. Even though it adds ~500KB to binary size, this is acceptable given the safety and capability benefits (can replace Redis, RabbitMQ in many cases).
* **Consequences**: Need to implement a lightweight process scheduler, message queues, and supervision trees. All concurrent code uses message passing. The runtime will be slightly larger but provides superior reliability.

### 7 Labeled arguments for clarity
* **Date**: 2026-01-27
* **Status**: ✅ Adopted
* **Decision**: I will require labeled arguments for same-type parameters and all Boolean parameters.
* **Context**: Function calls like `connect("localhost", 8080, 5000, true, false)` are impossible to understand without checking the definition. Which number is the port? What do those booleans mean? Labeled arguments solve this: `connect(host: "localhost", port: 8080, timeout: 5000, retry: true, async: false)` is immediately clear. The compiler enforces labels when (1) multiple parameters have the same type, or (2) any parameter is a Boolean, preventing ambiguous calls.
* **Consequences**: Function calls are more verbose but dramatically more readable. The parser must support labeled argument syntax. The type checker must enforce label requirements.

### 6 with expression for complex error handling
* **Date**: 2026-01-27
* **Status**: ✅ Adopted
* **Decision**: I will provide a `with` expression for complex error handling scenarios where different error types need different responses.
* **Context**: While `?` handles simple error propagation, sometimes you need to handle different errors differently (e.g., return 404 for NotFound, 403 for PermissionDenied, 401 for AuthError). The `with` expression allows binding multiple Results using `<-` and pattern matching on different error types in an `else` clause, similar to Haskell's do-notation.
* **Consequences**: The parser must support `with`/`do`/`else` syntax. The `<-` operator is only valid inside `with` blocks. The type checker must verify all error types are handled in the else clause.

### 5 defer statement for resource cleanup
* **Date**: 2026-01-27
* **Status**: ✅ Adopted
* **Decision**: I will add a `defer` statement (from Zig) for guaranteed resource cleanup.
* **Context**: Resource cleanup (closing files, freeing locks, etc.) must be reliable even when errors occur. Considered: (1) try/finally blocks - verbose and easy to forget, (2) RAII/destructors - implicit, hard to see cleanup order, (3) `defer` statement - explicit, clear cleanup order (reverse of declaration), always runs on scope exit. Defer makes cleanup visible and guaranteed without ceremony.
* **Consequences**: The compiler must track defer statements and ensure they execute on all exit paths (return, error, normal). Deferred calls execute in reverse order of declaration.

### 4 Doc tests for reliability
* **Date**: 2026-01-27
* **Status**: ✅ Adopted
* **Decision**: I will support doc tests where examples in `@doc` comments are automatically tested.
* **Context**: Documentation often becomes stale because examples aren't verified. Rust's doc tests solve this by making documentation runnable and testable. This ensures examples always work and documentation stays current. It's especially valuable for AI-assisted development where examples serve as additional test cases.
* **Consequences**: The test runner must extract code blocks from `@doc` comments and execute them. Examples must be valid Fern code. Failed doc tests fail the build.

### 3 Python-style indentation syntax
* **Date**: 2026-01-26
* **Status**: ✅ Adopted
* **Decision**: I will use significant indentation (Python-style) instead of braces or `end` keywords.
* **Context**: Readability is a primary goal. Compared options: (1) Braces `{}` - familiar but add visual noise, (2) `end` keywords - clear but verbose, (3) Significant whitespace - clean and minimal. Python proves indentation works at scale. Modern editors handle indentation well. The reduced visual noise improves readability significantly.
* **Consequences**: The lexer must track indentation levels and emit INDENT/DEDENT tokens. Mixed tabs/spaces must be rejected. Error messages must handle indentation errors clearly.

### 2 Implementing compiler in C with safety libraries
* **Date**: 2026-01-26
* **Status**: ✅ Adopted
* **Decision**: I will implement the Fern compiler in C11 with safety libraries (arena allocator, SDS strings, stb_ds collections, Result macros) instead of Rust, Zig, or C++.
* **Context**: Considered several implementation languages: (1) Rust - safe but complex, steep learning curve, slower compile times, (2) Zig - interesting but immature, fewer AI training examples, (3) C++ - too complex, many ways to do things wrong, (4) C with safety libraries - simple, well-understood by AI, fast compilation, full control. Using arena allocation eliminates use-after-free and memory leaks. Using SDS eliminates buffer overflows. Using Result macros eliminates unchecked errors. C is also extremely well-represented in AI training data, making AI-assisted development highly effective.
* **Consequences**: Must use arena allocator exclusively (no malloc/free). Must use SDS for all strings. Must use stb_ds for collections. Must use Result types for fallible operations. Compiler warnings must be treated as errors.

### 1 Compiling to C via QBE
* **Date**: 2026-01-26
* **Status**: ✅ Adopted
* **Decision**: I will compile Fern to C using `QBE` as an intermediate representation.
* **Context**: I considered three approaches: (1) `LLVM` - powerful but extremely complex with 20+ million lines of code and steep learning curve, (2) Direct machine code generation - too low-level and platform-specific, requiring separate backends for each architecture, (3) `QBE` - a simple SSA-based IL that compiles to C. QBE hits the sweet spot: it's only ~10,000 lines of code (AI can understand it fully), generates efficient C code, handles register allocation and optimization, and lets me target any platform C supports. The C output can then be compiled with any C compiler (gcc, clang, tcc) for maximum portability.
* **Consequences**: I need to generate QBE IL from Fern AST, then invoke QBE to produce C code, and finally compile the C code to native binaries. This adds an extra compilation step but dramatically simplifies the compiler implementation and ensures broad platform support. Single binaries under 1MB are still achievable.
