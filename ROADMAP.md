# Morrow Roadmap

> Fern was renamed to Morrow on 2026-09-15; historical measurements and acceptance records below retain their original names, paths and results.

Last updated: 2026-09-15

This file is the only active roadmap. Historical context is in [`docs/HISTORY.md`](docs/HISTORY.md).

## Current Status Snapshot

### Morrow rename (2026-09-15, Decision155)

- [x] Rename all 12 workspace packages, component paths, CLI, runtime symbols and Cargo tooling. macOS ARM64 `cargo xtask check` passes: 2,249 Rust tests, 316 native-output fixtures, 20 examples, 63 dynamic programs, 295 atomic rejections and 64+192+231 fuzz cases; dependency versions and persisted cluster identities remain unchanged.
- [x] Rename all 455 source files to `.mr` and update discovery, module imports, formatter, LSP requests and test/documentation fixtures. An independent discovery test fails before and passes after migration. The full macOS ARM64 `cargo xtask check` passes; all three standalone benchmark workspaces also pass tests, formatting and Clippy.
- [x] Update active documentation, public introductions, canonical URLs, editor settings and `MORROW_STYLE.md`. The full macOS ARM64 `cargo xtask check` and generated documentation site build pass. Forty-five historical Markdown records gain only a rename note; preserved data and earlier decision entries remain byte-for-byte unchanged.
- [x] Replace old logo usage with a Morrow text mark and update browser/preview branding. The served-page regression fails before and passes after the change; the full macOS ARM64 `cargo xtask check`, WASM-target Clippy, preview build and real Edge acceptance pass. Desktop and mobile screenshots confirm the text identity and layout; offline restart, reconnect and asset-integrity checks pass.
- [x] Transfer and rename the public GitHub repository to [`morrow-lang/morrow`](https://github.com/morrow-lang/morrow), preserving repository identity and default branch `main`. Set the Morrow description, canonical homepage and SSH origin; create public [`morrow-lang/morrow-lang.github.io`](https://github.com/morrow-lang/morrow-lang.github.io) for the docs site. GitHub metadata and local build are verified. Docs deployment and custom-domain setup remain separate follow-up work.
- Owner follow-ups: register both domains, configure the `.dev` → `.org` redirect, complete the EUIPO/DPMA classes 9/42 check, and supply a new logo.

- Morrow-owned implementation: Rust throughout the compiler, native runtime, language server, supervisor and repository tooling. The old C/QBE/bootstrap setup and Tree-sitter integration are removed. The recorded migration passed complete debug quality gates, selected optimized runtime/ABI checks and actual release archive/installation workflows on macOS/Linux ARM64. [Migration scope and evidence](docs/RUST_WORKSPACE.md); new actor/web work has separate validation below.
- Active product direction: supervised native actors and a reactive Morrow WebAssembly client, connected through typed WebSocket messages (Decision124). Actor payload heaps and copied messages, explicit compiler roots, a separate aggregate WASM backend, typed Morrow browser model/update/view and compiled native room actors are implemented. Optional durable room checkpoints pass native restart and real WebSocket acceptance. General framework packaging and scalable actor execution remain open; [preview scope](docs/WEB_PREVIEW.md) and Decision125 distinguish them from the completed Rust migration.
- System observability: an authenticated, read-only [dashboard](docs/ADMIN_DASHBOARD.md) and JSON endpoint expose host/build information, current/peak process memory, admission use and bounded per-worker observations without queuing behind native callbacks (Decision131). The preview shares its application access policy; separate operator roles, CPU utilization and individual actor/GC breakdowns remain open.

### Full-stack Actor and Browser Milestones

- [x] Add current and peak process RSS to the authenticated dashboard and JSON snapshots. Verify native macOS/Linux samplers with checked unit/parser cases and an isolated touched 32 MiB allocation; inspect the running macOS demo. The complete macOS `cargo xtask check` passes 1,936 Rust tests across 254 suites, 305 native fixtures, 19 examples, 63 dynamic compatibility programs, 295 atomic rejections and 64+192 fuzz cases, plus formatting, notices and Clippy. Memory readings describe the whole server process; unavailable observations remain explicit.

The [architecture and acceptance plan](docs/FULL_STACK_ARCHITECTURE.md) defines
ownership, scheduling, browser ABI and protocol contracts. The completed items
below describe bounded foundations, not completion of the larger acceptance plan.

- [x] Add an authenticated read-only system dashboard and schema-versioned JSON snapshots with bounded worker telemetry, last-observed occupancy, admission usage and host/build information (Decision131). Pass 12 optimized owner tests, nine real HTTP/WebSocket tests, desktop/small-phone inspection and the complete browser suite. Final macOS `cargo xtask check` passes 1,933 Rust tests across 254 suites, 305 native fixtures, 19 examples, 63 dynamic compatibility programs, 295 atomic rejections and 64+192 fuzz cases, plus formatting, notices and Clippy.

- [x] Adopt automatic memory without mandatory application borrow checking, actor-owned tracing heaps, a separate browser ABI and a Rust-authored first-party web/UI framework (Decision124).
- [x] Branch a separate WASM emitter from checked semantic IR, preserve i64 integers, execute scalar exports and reject unsupported types/capabilities through imported code before publishing output.
- [x] Add actor-owned payload heaps and bounded message/capture graph copying, with explicit compiler root frames and scoped runtime roots. Conservative native stack/register and heap-word scanning remain enabled.
- [x] Add a bounded precise linear-memory String heap to the WASM backend with compiler shadow roots and independent generated-module execution tests.
- [x] Build a Rust browser host with keyed accessible DOM updates, local filtering, focus preservation, bounded drafts/snapshots and explicit listener/socket cleanup. Compile and execute the Fern checklist policy in the real browser.
- [x] Add Rust HTTP/WebSocket serving and a typed command/snapshot protocol with session authentication, exact Origin/CSRF checks, admission and queue bounds, revision conflicts, bounded deduplication, revocation and explicit reconnect/reset outcomes.
- [x] Package the preview with embedded assets, generated bindings and a Rust offline service worker. Exercise two real clients, cached offline reload, drafts, reconnect and logout against the static ARM64 Linux server running unprivileged in an empty chroot. Validate x86-64 static ELF structure; x86-64 execution remains open.
- [x] Pass final macOS real-browser acceptance including compiled Fern policy, keyed focus, cold service-worker restart, offline draft/filter recovery, reconnect/revocation, a 320-pixel mobile layout and rejection of a tampered HTTP-200 cache update while retaining the prior offline application. Inspect desktop and mobile screenshots.
- [x] Revalidate the new work with macOS ARM64 `cargo xtask check` and equivalent Linux ARM64 coverage across a workspace check and resumed acceptance tail after storage recovery: formatting, Clippy, notices, workspace tests, 305 native fixtures, 18 examples, 63 dynamic compatibility programs, 295 atomic rejections and 64+192 fuzz cases. Separately pass 17 WASM, 17 native ABI and four compiler-root cases. Add the static x86-64 browser CI job; its GitHub execution remains unverified.
- [x] Pass the 2026-09-13 integrated macOS ARM64 `cargo xtask check`: formatting, complete notices, workspace Clippy, 1,869 standard Rust tests, 305 native-output fixtures, 18 examples, 63 dynamic compatibility programs, 295 atomic rejections and 64+192 fuzz cases. Pass the real browser i64-handle/offline/mobile/cache-integrity gate and link native application test executables statically for ARM64/x86-64 Linux. New Linux execution evidence remains separate from earlier preview acceptance.
- [x] Reuse actor slots under immutable nonwrapping generations. Pass 66,536 sequential spawn/finish transitions with precise control collection and bounded memory; preserve stale PID rejection, foreign-heap identity roots, supervision lineage and eventual dead-control reclamation (Decision129).
- [x] Suspend eligible recursive Unit-tail helper paths through copied, rooted callback frames. Independent native tests prove sibling progress, receive-arm/timeout and aliased-entry coverage, mutual recursion with collection at every handoff, and unchanged ordinary/no-actor CLI calls (Decision129).
- [x] Add seeded application simulation using the production protocol/client state machine and compiled native Fern actors, with per-session virtual time, bounded transport faults, actual durable reopen, an independent state oracle and mandatory healthy convergence. Versioned JSON reports replay exactly; forced corruption fails the checker (Decision130).
- [x] Add deterministic native callback-ABI scenarios for receive deadline ordering, yielding siblings, supervision, identity churn, clock errors and final managed-heap reclamation. A precise-collection test protects Session construction before host-root publication; simulation controls remain opt-in (Decision130).
- [x] Add a visible local draft preview and UTF-8 budget computed by Fern WASM, plus scoped pending save feedback, informed by the pinned LiveView source study. Independent native and Wasmi traces preserve the existing 100-task/two-held-view bound; final real-browser acceptance is recorded separately.
- [x] Fix durable recovery after deleting the last task, preserve valid empty decoded collection storage, and copy native map entries using the compiler’s untagged pair layout. Root partial typed JSON values across recursive allocation. Independent checkpoint, compiled Fern UTF-8/full-width map and forced precise-collection regressions pass.
- [x] Pass the final 2026-09-13 resilience macOS ARM64 `cargo xtask check`: formatting, notices, workspace Clippy, 1,924 Rust tests across 254 suites, 305 native fixtures, 19 examples, 63 dynamic compatibility programs, 295 atomic rejections and 64+192 fuzz cases. Pass final real-browser offline/feedback/mobile/cache-integrity acceptance, exact application/actor simulation replay and static ARM64/x86-64 Linux ELF checks. [Measured scenarios and artifact hashes](docs/DETERMINISTIC_SIMULATION.md).
- [x] Execute the resilience checkpoint `3be4025` on actual ARM64 Linux: 138 optimized runtime, checkpoint/clock, simulator and backend tests; byte-for-byte cross-platform replay of the macOS application/actor reports; full browser acceptance against the checksum-matched static ARM64 server, with desktop/mobile inspection. Keep x86-64 static validation distinct from execution.
- [x] Reproduce and fix CI fixture launch-state failures without weakening their oracles: explicit opener failure configuration and visible, painted screenshot readiness under the existing deadline. Pass the follow-up local gate with 1,927 Rust tests and all native/example/compatibility/fuzz checks; real-browser readiness starts from a hidden page. GitHub CI results are tracked separately from local acceptance.
- [x] Build and execute the static x86-64 Linux server in GitHub Actions at `a5f13e2`; pass the complete real-Chrome browser suite, including offline reload, Fern feedback, reconnect, mobile layout and cache-integrity rejection. [Job evidence](https://github.com/niklas-heer/fern/actions/runs/34773888739/job/103768321541).
- [x] Reproduce CI launcher descriptor leakage with an explicitly inherited non-CLOEXEC handle, including a handle above a lowered file limit. Fence inherited descriptors before the supervisor's `posix_spawn`, retaining the existing status, stream, descendant and cleanup oracles. All 27 optimized supervisor tests and Clippy pass on macOS ARM64 and actual Linux ARM64.
- [x] Pass the final descriptor-fix macOS ARM64 `cargo xtask check`: formatting, notices, workspace Clippy, 1,928 Rust tests across 254 suites, 305 native fixtures, 19 examples, 63 dynamic compatibility programs, 295 atomic rejections and 64+192 fuzz cases.
- [ ] Complete precise native root/layout coverage and general suspended-continuation lifetime checks. Charge copying and collection to measured work budgets.
- [ ] Extend resumable work-budget safepoints to arbitrary helper calls and collection loops; add an external-event scheduler and bounded blocking-service workers. Existing typed supervision and Unit-tail progress do not establish general preemption.
- [x] Extend WASM to records, tagged sums, Option/Result, lists and tuples with precise child tracing, managed i64/BigInt host handles and bounded UTF-8 transfer. Independent nested/full-width/Unicode/GC oracles and complete shared model/update/view traces pass. Maps, closures and indirect calls were added subsequently; see [current target support](docs/WASM_LANGUAGE.md). Native capabilities and WasmGC evaluation remain separate work.
- [x] Move the complete checklist browser model/update/view and server domain model into typed Fern. Link native Fern room actors into the Rust gateway with rooted thread-confined sessions, nonblocking polling and typed String reply ports. Real browser and WebSocket acceptance passes; generic rendering stays Rust. Shared wire-codec generation and application-independent packaging remain open.
- [x] Add actual compiled actor supervision with bounded restarts, fresh initializer heaps, cleanup, stale-PID rejection and unrelated actor progress between restart attempts. Add recoverable native embedding exports without process startup or an interpreter.
- [x] Pass independent native embedding tests for persistent room state, isolated rooms, full-width values, recoverable faults and 5,000 requests with precise host-root collection.
- [x] Add optional single-writer atomic room checkpoints before acknowledgement; recover tasks under fresh incarnations and command namespaces. Native reopen/lock/corruption tests and a real WebSocket server restart pass. This is room-state durability, not durable exactly-once external effects.
- [x] Pin rooms to configurable independent workers while sharing global ingress, room, namespace and connection limits. Prove other-worker and authentication progress while one domain callback is blocked, reject revoked queued commands, and preserve cross-worker reconnect at capacity. Share a durable writer with stale-owner rejection and independent concurrent-room recovery tests (Decision128).
- [x] Pass the integrated 2026-09-13 worker/lifecycle macOS ARM64 `cargo xtask check`: formatting, dependency notices, workspace Clippy, 1,890 Rust tests, 305 native fixtures, 18 examples, 63 dynamic compatibility programs, 295 atomic rejections and 64+192 fuzz cases. Includes canceled login/join/disconnect cleanup, partial worker startup and active ingress-permit ownership.
- [x] Rebuild final macOS/ARM64-musl/x86-64-musl web artifacts at `f80f55a`. Pass macOS browser acceptance and 98 focused optimized tests on actual ARM64 Linux, including six native compiler-tail oracles, plus the full browser suite against the checksum-matched static ARM64 server. Record [artifact sizes and exact scope](docs/WEB_APPLICATION_ACCEPTANCE.md); x86-64 remains statically validated without execution.
- [ ] Pass the full architecture acceptance cases with actual Morrow domain actors, actor failure/reset and independent aggregate ABI/GC oracles. Room sharding establishes independent-worker progress; arbitrary-helper scheduler fairness and live actor migration remain open.
- [x] Connect fixed room owners across configured servers with mutual TLS, certificate-bound identities, bounded forwarding streams, fresh-namespace uncertainty and checkpoint placement guards. Pass independent routing/lease simulation, hostile framing/authentication tests and a three-process 10,024-durable-mutation campaign across 32 clients; preserve state through partitions and owner restart. See [cluster contract and measurements](docs/CLUSTER.md).
- [x] Establish the initial Decision144 JSON baseline using primary Erlang, Phoenix, WebSocket, WebTransport and codec sources and 46 measured message fixtures with isolated CBOR/protobuf adapters and malformed-input oracles. Binary dependencies stayed outside production during that initial experiment; Decision145 below supersedes the default after browser and application measurements.
- [x] Extend the isolated codec comparison to real Chromium/WASM string and byte-array boundaries, with independent wire/value/malformed-input checks, 138 raw fixture rows and recorded artifact sizes. Run 7,650 loopback WebSocket mutations through the actual Hub, compiled Fern actor and optional durable checkpoint path. All exact transition and durable reopen checks pass. Binary messages reduce traffic and browser decode work; the larger application cases show essentially unchanged latency. Stage wall-time fractions do not establish CPU shares. See [measurements](docs/NETWORK_PROTOCOL.md).
- [x] Select protobuf for live browser and peer messages after those measurements (Decision145). Publish explicit application and peer schemas, retaining legacy browser JSON negotiation and separate HTTP/offline/checkpoint formats. This is the architectural selection; the integrated migration gate below remains separate.
- [x] Complete protobuf migration acceptance: both explicitly selected browser codecs, binary JS/WASM boundaries, mismatch and hostile-input rejection, cross-codec state convergence, real-browser offline/reconnect behavior, authenticated peer framing, partition/lost-response/restart stress, deterministic simulation and the complete repository gate. Do not treat the earlier JSON cluster stress measurements as a protobuf throughput result. Verified on macOS ARM64: 2,176 Rust tests, 311 native-output fixtures, 20 examples, 63 dynamic compatibility programs, 295 atomic rejections, 64+192+231 fuzz cases, formatting, notices and Clippy; real Edge acceptance includes two clients, offline/reconnect, session revocation and tampered-asset rejection. The separate mixed-gateway test preserves exact outcomes and state across JSON and protobuf clients.
- [x] Release checkpoint locks at writer teardown and on initialization failure even when a concurrent child retains a duplicated descriptor. Two independent regressions fail with the old lock lifetime and pass with explicit owned-guard release on macOS and Linux; active-writer exclusion and placement checks remain intact. The follow-up macOS `cargo xtask check` passes 2,178 Rust tests and the complete native/compatibility/fuzz gates, and the rebuilt server passes real-browser acceptance.
- [x] Compare the initial Fern baseline with optimized Rust and Bun 1.4.2/TypeScript 6.0.2 using runtime-input scalar and immutable-model workloads, independent mathematical oracles, compiler mutation diagnostics and positive controls. Preserve 174 performance samples, full-width Number/BigInt observations, process RSS, source build/check timings, binary sizes and first-launch outliers. That baseline uses little memory and checks small sources quickly, but immutable model updates are substantially slower; its generated native code selects Cranelift `opt_level=none`. See the [historical experiment report](benchmarks/language-comparison/README.md); these tests do not establish developer productivity or whole-language superiority.
- [x] Profile immutable callbacks and replace repeated GC frame tree updates with reusable storage and direct range scanning (Decision146). Preserve exact payloads, old versions, heap isolation and fault cleanup with independent native oracles, 8,192 seeded lifetime operations and a failing-before/passing-after allocation regression. The unchanged model is 2.73–2.94× faster with similar RSS. Full macOS gate: 2,183 Rust tests, 311 native fixtures, 20 examples, 63 dynamic compatibility programs, 295 atomic rejections and 64+192+231 fuzz cases pass; see the [paired measurements](benchmarks/language-comparison/IMMUTABLE.md).
- [x] Enable optimized native emission, prove bounded direct list traversal/builders, and inline small statically known list callbacks while retaining dynamic/control/actor fallbacks (Decision147). Preserve 342 staged timing samples: unchanged immutable updates improve another 2.98–3.71×, scalar performance is unchanged, and small-source builds grow about 4%. Full macOS gate passes 2,193 Rust tests, 311 native fixtures, 20 examples, 63 dynamic compatibility programs, 295 atomic rejections and 64+192+231 fuzz cases, including precise-GC, exact-payload, fault/cleanup, historical-alias and fallback oracles. See [native optimization evidence](benchmarks/language-comparison/NATIVE_OPTIMIZATION.md).
- [x] Compare the optimized native implementation with Elixir 1.20.4 on OTP 29.0.6/JIT and optimized Rust. Preserve 224 whole-process and 40 in-VM samples, 1,744 independent result checks, initial immutable aliases, tuple/struct alternatives, startup, RSS and pinned artifact hashes. Separate startup-amortized work from BEAM compute timing; this establishes no actor, scheduler or distributed-system performance parity. See the [BEAM experiment](benchmarks/language-comparison/BEAM.md).
- [x] Expose safe constant integer division/remainder and retain eligible all-Int self-tail parameters in SSA (Decision148). Preserve 113,508 independent wide-arithmetic outputs, 357 recurrence/permutation cases, operand/fault/cleanup/root behavior and 246 staged timing samples. The final scalar workload improves 76.60→66.57 ms against Rust's 57.35 ms; immutable-model timings are essentially unchanged. Retain the slower constant-only experiment and verify both changes are needed with an SSA-only control. Full macOS gate passes 2,202 Rust tests, 311 native fixtures, 20 examples, 63 dynamic compatibility programs, 295 atomic rejections and 64+192+231 fuzz cases. See [arithmetic evidence](benchmarks/language-comparison/ARITHMETIC.md).
- [x] Move heap ownership from thread-local storage into an explicit `Domain`, leaving the thread-local as a scheduling cursor behind an `Activation` guard, as step 1 of five toward parallel actor execution (Decision156). Preserve behaviour exactly: the seeded actor scenario reproduces trace hash `01a55a0046de5614` with identical callbacks, restarts and churn, and zero cleanup residue. The runtime suite grows 99→107 tests, adds a cross-heap edge oracle with a failing negative case, and runs clean under ThreadSanitizer in 2,389.85 s. The full macOS gate passes 316 native-output fixtures, 20 examples, 63 dynamic compatibility programs, 295 atomic rejections and 64+192+231 fuzz cases. The allocation-heavy immutable model regresses 59.03→59.96 ms (+1.58%) while the scalar control moves +0.09%, locating the cost in the allocation path; the regression is recorded, not rounded off.
- [ ] Continue profiling broader inlining, immutable collection representation/allocation, native actor execution, the native JSON bridge and checkpoint work independently. Preserve exact output, rooting/GC and fault oracles when improving measured bottlenecks.
- [ ] Prove sustained multi-worker fairness, lifecycle churn and performance beyond the bounded cluster acceptance workload. Add transactional external-effect recovery, dynamic membership and replicated ownership/failover as separate gates.

### Rust Workspace Completion

- [x] Organize the Cargo workspace under `crates/` with compiler, core runtime, startup archive, shared JSON engine and supervisor boundaries; keep repository automation in `xtask`.
- [x] Port full-width values, strings/lists, Unicode16 decimal classification, JSON/codecs, IO, HTTP/SQL/regex, terminal widgets and actors to Rust.
- [x] Replace Boehm with a Rust-owned nonmoving collector. Root/interior-pointer, cycle, pressure and finalized-value checks pass, including a pointer retained only by Cranelift-generated code across collection.
- [x] Root all managed strings held only by a Rust Vec before allocating copies. The regression reproduced corruption before the fix and passes debug/release with forced collection.
- [x] Use Cranelift for all native compilation, including source tests and doctests. Independent output fixtures and optimized ABI/GC tests pass on both ARM64 platforms.
- [x] Replace native process supervision with Rust retained-identity cleanup and a shared bounded parent protocol. Lifecycle, cancellation, descriptor, descendant and terminal tests pass.
- [x] Move building, checking, fuzzing, measurement, packaging, installation and uninstall to Rust tooling. Retire C/Python bootstrap, style and maintenance implementations; preserve executable compatibility assertions in Rust.
- [x] Remove Tree-sitter and its Zed grammar package; keep the Rust LSP. Use static accessible generated documentation with browser Find, removing the authored JavaScript filter.
- [x] Prefer native Rust dependencies while allowing Rust wrappers around third-party native libraries, as explicitly authorized. Preserve SQLite through rusqlite and certificate-verifying HTTP through ureq/rustls; retain complete notices.
- [x] Pass final debug quality gates: 1,752/1,754 standard workspace tests plus five custom IO/PTY cases per macOS/Linux host; 305 independent native fixtures, 18 examples, 63 dynamic applications, 295 atomic rejections, unit-test continuation and 64+192 fuzz cases on each.
- [x] Pass targeted optimized runtime/JSON/supervisor checks (92 standard tests plus five custom protocols per host) and 12 separate object/ABI/GC tests. This does not claim the entire compiler integration suite was run optimized.
- [x] Preserve 26 Rust distribution contracts and 18 negative/two positive lint policy probes. Both platforms pass three compiler-phase fixture tests and ten benchmark smoke phases.
- [x] Complete refreshed release artifact, relocation/install/source-test/uninstall and performance records for both ARM64 platforms. Archive and performance reports identify matching component hashes; no x86-64 execution, complete optimized compiler suite or 1.0 release is implied.
- [x] Refresh the public README around Fern's purpose, Rust implementation policy, verified platform scope and preview limits. Execute the greeting, quickstart run/build and HTML documentation command; verify local links and contributor guidance.

### Previous Compiler-Default Acceptance

- Rust compiler migration: complete on macOS arm64 and Linux arm64. Build, install and release workflows select Rust as `fern`; `fern-c` remains the explicit C bootstrap/reference. [Acceptance evidence](docs/history/RUST_DEFAULT_MIGRATION.md).
- Compiler gates: Rust/QBE passes 1,621/1,624 Cargo tests on macOS/Linux; Cranelift passes 1,633/1,636. Both platforms pass 305 independent backend native-output cases and ten migration programs.
- Quality gate: full clean quality gates pass, including 574 C tests, 18 examples, runtime/native oracles, strict style and 66 workflow parity cases; documentation and real-server LSP checks pass on both platforms.
- Fuzz gate: unchanged 64-case `0xC0FFEE` smoke passes for both compilers on both platforms; the 512-case compatibility stretch passes for Rust and C on macOS. Rust's separate 192-mutation corpus passes on both platforms.
- Bootstrap and developer tools: full native style-launcher checks, 18 negative lint contracts and all ten compiler-phase benchmark smoke cases pass on both platforms. Opener and retry-limit fixtures now have deterministic execution/clock inputs.
- Perf gate: combined release builds take 44.21 s on macOS and 44.01 s on Linux. Rust compiler sizes are 3,823,744/3,806,232 bytes and startup p95 is 6.62/0.41 ms; C independently retains its 1,500,000-byte ceiling. All enforced budgets pass.
- Docs gate: documentation consistency, eight snippet-runner regressions and the executable stdlib example pass on both platforms.
- Distribution: nine installation checks and ten checks of each actual relocated release archive pass. Exact compiler/helper/runtime/license inputs and matching source-tree hashes are recorded in the acceptance report.
- Release readiness: QBE remains the default backend; the C runtime, native supervisor and editor parser retain their existing implementations. Generalized actors, remaining language/stdlib/editor work, backend promotion and a 1.0 release have separate exit criteria in [release readiness](docs/RELEASE_READINESS.md).

## Rust Frontend Evaluation (2026-09-05)

Status: Historical bounded prototype checkpoint. Its quality, Rust and documentation gates passed while C was the shipping default (Decision45). The current build and installation select Rust as `fern`; see Rust Migration Completion below.

- [x] Build an independent lexer/parser for a clearly bounded Fern subset (11 parser tests).
- [x] Resolve names and types once into a typed intermediate representation (10 checker tests).
- [x] Generate QBE exclusively from typed IR and reuse the C runtime/backend (17 emitter tests and native execution).
- [x] Add check/emit/build/run commands and specification-grounded differential tests (51 Rust tests, 32 native programs, 5 invalid inputs, literal paths).
- [x] Measure clean/incremental frontend builds, check/emit latency, binary sizes, and native execution.
- [x] Record evidence, gaps, and a migration recommendation before expanding scope ([evaluation](docs/history/RUST_FRONTEND_EVALUATION.md)): continue Rust incrementally; require parity before switching defaults.

## Active Priorities

- [x] Add explicit SQLite close with bounded live connections, stale-handle rejection and rollback/lock release (debug/release/sanitizer groups and exact C/Rust native outputs; Decision113).
- [x] Preserve optional regex capture positions, including absent versus empty groups and later participating groups (seven shared-runtime native cases; Rust source oracle added).
- [x] Promote expired actor timers at every cooperative boundary, preserve deadline/identity wake ordering after timely unmatched or late sends, and retire cached timers without spurious clock faults (2,048 deterministic FernSim timeout dispatches per debug/release/sanitizer mode).
- [x] Preserve NaN sign, payload and signaling bits in QBE machine transport, matching Cranelift without decimal canonicalization (18 independently specified native bit-pattern outputs and serializer regression).

- [x] Showcase native string interpolation in the README greeting; exact `Hello, Fern!` output verified on both C and Rust compilers.

- [x] Refresh the public README around runnable onboarding, accurate feature boundaries and a dedicated Fern logo; greeting and quickstart outputs verified on both compilers, with light/dark presentation checked.

### Development Environment and Rust Review Guidance

- [x] Adopt nightly-2026-09-06 across mise, direct Cargo, CI and developer jobs; verify component identities and drift, 18 negative lint contracts, complete macOS/Linux Rust/native/C/docs/nextest gates and all ten benchmark smoke cases. Bacon check/Clippy and watchexec initial/source-change jobs select nightly (Decision111).

- [x] Replace Justfile with pinned mise tools/tasks and platform checksums; preserve sequential native builds and explicit Zed toolchain scope (Decision106).
- [x] Verify optional nextest, Bacon and watchexec without adding application dependencies (initial Rust1.75 checkpoint; nightly migration above supersedes the project pin).
- [x] Lock all three Python reference-script dependency graphs and reject metadata drift before execution.
- [x] Preserve quoted native compiler flags and pkg-config paths through bounded literal decoding; cover all build helpers and 128 generated argument roundtrips.
- [x] Add the strict incremental Rust lint policy and initial-path fix, with 17 negative/two positive lint contracts, three fixture tests, ten Criterion phase smoke cases and the review-guidance adoption matrix (Decision107).
- [x] Audit native linker-argument and test-frame boundaries under strict lints; preserve Unicode paths, reject malformed/oversized records and validate complete status/payload domains.
- [x] Preserve literal pkg-config library-directory metadata and reject malformed successful records before archive lookup, fallback or link publication.
- [ ] Extend audited strict modules and collect quiet-host comparative phase measurements.
- [x] Verify the combined environment/compiler gates on macOS and freshly provisioned Linux tools: full Rust/native/C/cache/docs gates, 1409/1410 nextest tests without skips, 23 workflow/flag/lock tests, lint contracts and Criterion smoke.

### Rust Migration Completion

- [x] Make the native supervisor retry-limit oracle independent of elapsed wall time, retaining exact retry counts and real deadline coverage (complete debug/release/sanitizer protocol matrices pass on macOS/Linux).

- [x] Remove executable-write races from documentation opener tests using immutable scripts and private symlinks; retain literal non-UTF-8 argv and timeout assertions (six complete parallel Linux binary-suite runs pass).

- [x] Restore bounded inline match arms with guarded patterns, canonical formatting and explicit nested/caller comma ownership (37 focused parser/formatter checks, ten native migration programs, 512 unchanged seeded parser/formatter cases per compiler; Decision121).

- [x] Preserve consistent tab indentation, eight-column layout and byte-correct spans while rejecting mixed styles; canonical formatting uses spaces (24 focused parser/formatter tests and Clippy; Decision120).

Compiler migration acceptance is complete. Historical checkpoints and remaining
language, runtime, editor and backend work below retain their own exit criteria.

- [x] Add non-faulting `List.at/first/last/take/drop` and exact `Int.parse` with full-width heap Options; independent runtime ABI, native output, REPL and symbol-inventory tests pass (Decision150; [stdlib reference](docs/STDLIB_API_REFERENCE.md)).
- [x] Name the nearest known symbol in unknown name/function/field/type/module-member diagnostics, list missing constructors in exhaustiveness errors and retire "Rust prototype" parser wording (Decision149).
- [x] Add `List.sort/zip/range/sum` and `Int.checked_add/sub/mul/div/rem/neg`; report argument type mismatches before missing labels. Independent runtime ABI, native output (`sequences/utilities.fn`, `numeric/checked.fn`), REPL and inventory tests pass (Decision151).
- [x] Print lists, maps, options, results, tuples and `derive(Show)` types directly through `println` with an on-demand trait prelude; missing `Show` reports the type with a derive hint (Decision152; `traits/printing.fn`).
- [x] Sort structured and generic elements through `Ord` (`List.sort`) or an explicit comparator (`List.sort_by`) with a stable runtime-driven merge that never crosses the callback ABI; render nested strings as quoted literals (`String.quote`) natively, in the REPL and in wasm; print generic parameters through `Show`. Independent runtime state-machine, native output (`sequences/sort_by.fn`, `traits/printing.fn`), REPL, Wasmi and checker tests pass (Decision153).
- [ ] Complete the specified standard modules, including data formats, testing/utilities, IO/system, cryptography and compression.
- [ ] Audit all specified syntax and stdlib calls for complete typecheck-to-native behavior; reject unsupported execution paths.
- [ ] Complete precise actor memory, fair scheduling and full typed browser application support above. Inferred ownership/reuse remains an optimization, not a mandatory application borrow checker (Decision124).

## Next Session Start Here

The Rust-only workspace migration is complete within its recorded acceptance
scope. The active direction is the full-stack actor/browser plan above. Continue
using the Rust runtime and Cranelift through `cargo xtask check`; historical
compiler-default evidence does not validate new runtime or browser features.

1. Complete native root/layout coverage and resumable actor continuations; establish independent fairness, actor failure and resource-cleanup oracles before adding workers. Preserve full-width values and bounded lifecycle contracts.
2. Extend the aggregate WASM backend beyond the tested application surface; derive shared wire schemas and add application-independent framework packaging. Preserve actual Morrow model/update/view and native actor acceptance.
3. Preserve the working static/offline application, fixed-owner clusters and durable room recovery while extending measured progress and transactional external-effect recovery. Treat dynamic membership and replicated failover as separate milestones.
4. Close supporting language/stdlib gaps in [release readiness](docs/RELEASE_READINESS.md), maintain the Rust LSP, and collect fresh native/browser correctness and performance evidence. Tree-sitter remains removed.
