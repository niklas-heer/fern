# Fern Roadmap

Last updated: 2026-09-06

This file is the only active roadmap. Historical context is in [`docs/HISTORY.md`](docs/HISTORY.md).

## Current Status Snapshot

- Quality gate: `mise run check` passing (574 C tests, 16 full-width Int programs, native file/process/stderr/workflow/string/print tests, 13 TUI tests, 18 examples, strict style); validated with stale host `LIBRARY_PATH` excluded
- Perf gate: `mise run perf-budget` passing on macOS arm64 (7.49 s build, 549,384-byte compiler, 2.82 ms startup p95)
- Fuzz gate: `mise run fuzz-smoke` passing (64 cases, seed `0xC0FFEE`)
- Docs gate: `mise run docs-check` passing (consistency, generation, doc tests); LSP RPC smoke passing
- Release readiness: `mise run release-package` and `mise run release-package-check` passing; full-language blockers remain in `docs/RELEASE_READINESS.md`
- Sanitizer gate: AddressSanitizer/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer passing on six actor scenarios and three TUI scenarios (GC leak reporting excluded).
- Bootstrap gate: Fern-native default checker, exact native/Python diagnostic and 66 workflow parity cases, bounded content cache and native supervision verified on macOS/Linux; ordinary style checks need no Python/Cargo
- Rust migration: `mise run rust-check` passing (1515 Rust checks on nightly-2026-09-06 (1518 on Linux; bounded native actors and relocatable previews), 4 measurement-harness tests, 197 core native programs, 13 newtype programs, 12 namespace programs, 5 labeled-call programs, 27 union programs, 22 entry/access programs, 9 controlled-fault cases, 241 invalid inputs, dual-frontend directory/Result contracts, 192 mutations); expanded frontend remains opt-in; process/stdio and full C/Rust gates also pass on Linux arm64
- Rust developer tooling: pinned mise environment and incremental lint-policy checks verified; nextest passes 1511 tests on macOS and 1513 on Linux without skips; Criterion fixtures and all 10 smoke cases pass on both. Actor20-program/16-rejection, managed-runtime sanitizer and moved-preview gates pass on both.

## Rust Frontend Evaluation (2026-09-05)

Status: Complete for the bounded prototype; `mise run check`, `mise run rust-check`, and `mise run docs-check` pass on macOS arm64. CI includes Linux/macOS Rust checks. C remains the shipping default (decision 45).

- [x] Build an independent lexer/parser for a clearly bounded Fern subset (11 parser tests).
- [x] Resolve names and types once into a typed intermediate representation (10 checker tests).
- [x] Generate QBE exclusively from typed IR and reuse the C runtime/backend (17 emitter tests and native execution).
- [x] Add check/emit/build/run commands and specification-grounded differential tests (51 Rust tests, 32 native programs, 5 invalid inputs, literal paths).
- [x] Measure clean/incremental frontend builds, check/emit latency, binary sizes, and native execution.
- [x] Record evidence, gaps, and a migration recommendation before expanding scope ([evaluation](docs/RUST_FRONTEND_EVALUATION.md)): continue Rust incrementally; require parity before switching defaults.

## Active Priorities

- [x] Refresh the public README around runnable onboarding, accurate feature boundaries and a dedicated Fern logo; greeting and quickstart outputs verified on both compilers, with light/dark presentation checked.

### Development Environment and Rust Review Guidance

- [x] Adopt nightly-2026-09-06 across mise, direct Cargo, CI and developer jobs; verify component identities and drift, 18 negative lint contracts, complete macOS/Linux Rust/native/C/docs/nextest gates and all ten benchmark smoke cases. Bacon check/Clippy and watchexec initial/source-change jobs select nightly (Decision111).

- [x] Replace Justfile with pinned mise tools/tasks and platform checksums; preserve sequential native builds and explicit Zed toolchain scope (Decision106).
- [x] Verify optional nextest, Bacon and watchexec without adding application dependencies (initial Rust1.75 checkpoint; nightly migration above supersedes the project pin).
- [x] Lock all three Python reference-script dependency graphs and reject metadata drift before execution.
- [x] Preserve quoted native compiler flags and pkg-config paths through bounded literal decoding; cover all build helpers and 128 generated argument roundtrips.
- [x] Add the strict incremental Rust lint policy and initial-path fix, with 17 negative/two positive lint contracts, three fixture tests, ten Criterion phase smoke cases and the review-guidance adoption matrix (Decision107).
- [x] Audit native linker-argument and test-frame boundaries under strict lints; preserve Unicode paths, reject malformed/oversized records and validate complete status/payload domains.
- [x] Preserve literal pkg-config library-directory metadata and reject malformed successful records before archive lookup, fallback or link publication.
- [ ] Extend audited strict modules and collect quiet-host comparative phase measurements.
- [x] Verify the combined environment/compiler gates on macOS and freshly provisioned Linux tools: full Rust/native/C/cache/docs gates, 1409/1410 nextest tests without skips, 23 workflow/flag/lock tests, lint contracts and Criterion smoke.

### Rust Migration Completion

User authorization: continue through every migration milestone without stopping
for approval between milestones. C remains the default until the parity gates pass.

- [x] Custom algebraic/record types, generic functions, nested patterns and guards (41 checker and 36 emitter tests; native recursive values and guarded matching).
- [x] Modules/imports/visibility and a realistic application spanning multiple files (13 loader tests including visibility bypass regressions, native project execution).
- [ ] Remaining executable language parity: remaining function/numeric/string operations, control flow and complete error handling.
- [x] Replace reference-only Result checks with bounded reachable-path handling, call/alias provenance, complete collection coverage and deferred cleanup (Decision95).
- [x] Prove direct recursive nominal Result handlers, complete List/Map child traversals, exact recursive callbacks and deferred child handling (Decision95 R1–R2).
- [x] Prove complete mutual structural handler groups over actual nominal descendants, including typed List/Map traversal and transparent wrapped children, with independent source-order and unsafe-path probes (Decision95 R3).
- [x] Verify the combined boundary/CLI/Result checkpoint on macOS and Linux: full Rust/native/C/docs gates, 1447/1449 nextest tests without skips, separate doctests and Criterion smoke.
- [ ] Complete recursive builders and wider recursive summary equations without granting unproved handling credit.
- [ ] Standard-library/native ABI compatibility and executable application coverage.
- [ ] Diagnostics, formatting, REPL/LSP, documentation and developer-command parity.
- [x] Preserve common quiet/verbose/color controls, literal forwarded argv, visible failures and missing-command status in the Rust CLI (Decision108A).
- [x] Add bounded source-only lex/parse inspection with byte spans, escaped dumps, no import/type/backend execution and atomic parser/limit failure (Decision108B).
- [x] Open retained HTML documentation only after complete atomic generation, with literal platform argv, visible best-effort failures and consistent byte limits (Decision108C).
- [x] Verify the 1006-test expanded Rust checkpoint, C quality gate and documentation on Linux arm64 with Rust 1.75; expose POSIX test APIs under glibc strict C11 without hiding Darwin extensions.
- [x] Package explicit Rust/native inputs as a relocatable opt-in preview, with deterministic bounded archives, atomic publication, strict verification and missing-helper isolation (Decision110).
- [ ] Linux/macOS verification, fuzz/performance/packaging gates and default migration.

Each checkpoint below records verified scope; this completion list stays open
until all of its acceptance criteria are actually satisfied.

- [x] Add a lightweight docs consistency check to CI (link + key status marker validation)

Exit criteria:
- Working tree does not accumulate tracked generated binaries during normal benchmark/release flows.
- Every top-level process document links to canonical docs and active roadmap.

### Priority 2: Milestone 8 Follow-Through (Actor Runtime Semantics)

Status: Active

- [x] Enforce restart budgets at time zero, single replacement lineage, acyclic ownership, invalid PID rejection, and stopped-sibling semantics (six runtime scenarios, 1,536 seeded crash steps)

- [ ] Expand deterministic FernSim scenarios for supervision trees and failure policies
- [x] Add stronger actor runtime invariants to regression suites (seeded native-runtime scenarios)

Exit criteria:

### Priority 3: Milestone 9 Bootstrapping

Status: Complete for the native quality-checker bootstrap workflow

- [x] Compare exact diagnostics, severity, messages, and exits on pinned failing fixtures and all `src`/`lib` sources (strict, lenient, summary, nested paths)

- [x] Add fallible exact stderr output with thread-local SIGPIPE preservation (nine native groups in debug/release/sanitizer builds; six source-native cases and two atomic rejections per frontend).
- [x] Accept interpolated strings as indented C-parser body expressions (three AST regressions), including final branches followed by else.
- [x] Run the native build/test/example/Git workflow through literal bounded argv, preserve stderr CLI failures and compare 47 scenarios under both frontends.
- [x] Reach pinned diagnostic/workflow parity for `scripts/check_style.py` in `scripts/check_style.fn`, including Unicode numeric-path prefix classification (66 reference-first workflow cases under both frontends).
- [x] Add parity assertions to CI (`mise run style-parity` as a required gate)
- [x] Make the Fern-native checker the default through a content-validated C-bootstrap launcher; verify cold/warm caches, source and external inputs, concurrency, failure, ownership and independent Python parity on macOS/Linux (Decision93).

- [x] Add canonical TUI examples with deterministic test coverage

Validation: 13 native and PTY tests cover input/password editing, Unicode, EOF/cancellation, terminal restoration, cursor controls, immutable trees, log escaping, and the canonical Fern example. Other prompt variants retain line-based input.

Exit criteria:
- TUI surface is complete enough to support first-party tooling UX needs.

### Priority 5: Milestone 11 Polish and Optimization

Status: Active

- [ ] Reduce binary size and startup variance further while preserving ergonomics
- [x] Tighten release checklist and pre-1.0 readiness criteria
- [x] Expand user-facing docs (language guide/tutorial) for adoption

Exit criteria:
- Pre-1.0 release checklist is explicit, measurable, and continuously validated.

## User Workflow Closure (2026-09-05)

## Next Session Start Here

For the active Rust migration, finish bounded process/bootstrap workflows and remaining editor grammar parity, then the remaining
specified syntax and native/stdlib parity.
Control flow, closures, maps, function clauses and generic-body validation have
verified checkpoints. Preserve the concrete type/ABI and native-output gates in
[migration progress](docs/RUST_MIGRATION.md).

1. Extend the bounded native actor checkpoint to generalized suspension, typed supervision and REPL/FernSim parity; preserve the verified mailbox and lifecycle contracts.
2. Preserve the verified native checker default and its C-bootstrap/reference parity while completing the Rust command migration.
3. Close remaining spec-to-execution gaps using native-output tests, starting with JSON and server/data APIs.
