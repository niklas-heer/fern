# Compiler phase benchmarks

This separate, unpublished workspace measures the actual Rust frontend with
Criterion 0.5.1. It adds no dependencies to the production compiler. Its own
version-3 lockfile was built and tested with Rust 1.75.0; always use `--locked`.
Updating transitive dependencies without that lock can select a newer MSRV
(the initial resolution selected an edition-2024 clap_lex and failed on 1.75).
The lock retains clap 4.5.4 and half 2.4.1. No Cargo install is needed.

From the repository root:

```sh
cargo test --manifest-path benchmarks/compiler-phases/Cargo.toml --locked
cargo clippy --manifest-path benchmarks/compiler-phases/Cargo.toml --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo bench --manifest-path benchmarks/compiler-phases/Cargo.toml --locked --bench phases -- --test
cargo bench --manifest-path benchmarks/compiler-phases/Cargo.toml --locked --bench phases -- --save-baseline local
cargo bench --manifest-path benchmarks/compiler-phases/Cargo.toml --locked --bench phases -- --baseline local
```

Mise integration exposes the smoke run as `rust-bench-smoke` and the statistical
run as `rust-bench`; the explicit `--bench phases` avoids passing Criterion
options to Rust's library-test runner. A populated Cargo cache also supports
`--offline`; first setup must fetch the locked developer dependencies.

The three fixtures are a 64-function scalar program, a generic recursive
component instantiated at two types, and a derived JSON record. Each is parsed,
checked and emitted before timing starts. Tests also verify its REPL behavior,
generic specialization, entry ABI, and actual codec/storage graph. Nine cases
measure parsing source bytes, checking a pre-parsed AST, or emitting already
checked IR. A tenth validates the actual JSON record codec plan. The proof case
measures validation, not JSON encoding throughput or native runtime execution.

Inputs and returned results cross `std::hint::black_box`; allocation and drop
of the measured phase's output are included. Fixture construction, source I/O,
process startup and preparation of earlier phases are outside the loops.
The source-byte throughput label is a fixture-size normalization, not a claim
that checking/emission scan only that many bytes. No benchmark is an empty
stand-in for a future phase.

Each case uses 50 samples, 500 ms warm-up and a 2 s measurement target. Criterion
stores estimates, confidence intervals and raw sample data in this package's
`target/criterion/`. Its default Rayon/plotting/async features are disabled;
`cargo_bench_support` is sufficient for this command-line workload.
See the [pinned feature manifest](https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs/blob/0.5.1/Cargo.toml)
and [Criterion's measurement guide](https://bheisler.github.io/criterion.rs/book/user_guide/timing_loops.html).

`baseline-guidance107.json` records one real development-machine run, fixture
implementation and lock hashes, toolchain, and confidence intervals. It validates
the statistical workflow; it is not a performance threshold or comparison.
Other agents were using the host during measurement. Re-measure before/after
changes on the same quiet machine/toolchain and inspect distributions before
claiming improvement. CI uses the deterministic smoke run, not timing thresholds.

These measurements complement `scripts/evaluate_rust_frontend.py`, which measures
subprocess cold/warm compilation and backend comparison. They do not replace
native correctness, memory/resource, platform, or backend evaluation gates.

## Actor preparation review

The [paired phase record](actor105-preparation-review.json) compares exact unchanged
fixtures on Rust 1.75/Criterion 0.5.1 in release mode: pre-actor commit 05c4d27, the
frozen actor candidate, and the borrowed-program optimization. Order was
pre-actor/actor/optimized/optimized/actor/pre-actor, giving paired reversals.
It records source/build identities, load, per-run 95% intervals and timing scope.

| Fixture | Pre-actor µs | Actor µs | Optimized µs | Improvement from actor |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Scalar 64 functions | 184.26 | 273.09 | 204.21 | 25.22% |
| Generic SCC | 42.22 | 58.41 | 45.94 | 21.35% |
| JSON record | 13.46 | 16.96 | 13.95 | 17.71% |

Values average two run medians on macOS arm64. This exploratory shared-host run
removes 77–86% of the added phase time; 3.6–10.8% remains versus pre-actor with all
original universal validation retained. Host contention/frequency was not controlled.
This does not measure end-to-end compilation or native execution, and does not
isolate the cost of each internal pass. Non-actor IL matches pre-actor bytes;
actor IL and fault mappings match the unoptimized actor candidate.
